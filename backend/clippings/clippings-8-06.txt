There is a very strange thought experiment that exploits this act of looking as the electrons pass through the slits in the screen. Suppose I could make a bomb that would be activated by a single electron hitting a sensor. The trouble is that there is no guarantee that the bomb works. Classically, the only way to test this seems to be the rather useless act of firing an electron at the bomb. If it goes off, I know it works. If it doesn’t, then it’s a dud. But either way, after testing, I don’t have a bomb. The weird thing is that I can use the double-slit experiment to detect working bombs without setting them off. Remember that there were places on the screen where the electron can’t hit if it is really going through both slits at the same time. If I detect an electron at this point, it means I must have been looking and forced the electron to choose one slit or the other. We are going to use this region as the ‘bomb detector region’. Place the bomb’s sensor at the location of one of the slits, and if the bomb is a dud, the sensor won’t activate it. We are making no observations if it is a dud.

To say that thoughts cause behaviour is to say at least the following things:  The relation between thought and behaviour involves the truth of a counterfactual to the effect that, given the circumstances, if the thought had not been there, then the behaviour would not have been there. To cite a thought, or bunch of thoughts, as the cause of a piece of behaviour is to explain the behaviour, since citing causes is one way of explaining effects. Causes typically involve regularities or laws, so, if there is a causal relationship between thought and behaviour, then we might expect there to be regularities in the connection between thought and behaviour.

According to this view, the mind is a causal mechanism: a part of the causal order of nature, just as the liver and the heart are part of the causal order of nature. And we find out about the minds of others in just the same way that we find out about the rest of nature: by their effects. The mind is a kind of mechanism that has its effects in behaviour.

However, in the way it is normally understood, the claim that common-sense psychology is a theory is not just the claim that there are principles which describe the behaviour of mental states. The additional claim is that mental states are what philosophers call ‘theoretical entities’. In other words, it is not just that mental states are describable by a theory, but also that the (true, complete) theory of mental states tells us everything there is to know about them.

Given that scientific psychology and common-sense psychology are concerned with the same thing – the mind – the question of the relationship between them becomes urgent. There are many approaches one can take to this relationship, but in the end they boil down to two: vindication or elimination.

In fact, eliminative materialists normally claim that none of the mental states talked about in our common-sense psychology exist. In other words, there are no beliefs, desires, intentions, memories, hopes, fears and so on.

Let’s introduce a standard technical term for this sort of natural regularity: call the relation between X and Y, when X is a natural sign of Y, reliable indication. In general, X reliably indicates Y when there is a reliable causal link between X and Y. So, smoke reliably indicates fire, clouds reliably indicate thunder, and the spots reliably indicate measles.

Of course, we could make a mistake, and look at the smallpox spots and conclude: measles! But this is irrelevant. The theory is meant to explain the representational powers of our minds in terms of reliable indication – on this theory, we cannot appeal to the interpretation we give of a phenomenon in explaining what it represents. This would get matters the wrong way round.

In a famous discussion, Stephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin drew an analogy between adaptationist explanations of traits and spurious explanations of why certain artefacts have the form they have.7 Looking at the fabulous mosaics in the arches of the doorway of St Mark’s basilica in Venice, one might be led to think that the spaces between the arches (called ‘spandrels’) were designed in order that the mosaics might be put there. But this is not so: the spandrels are a mere side effect of the building of the arches, and the inspired artist or artists took advantage of the space to create something beautiful. The spandrels were not built in order to make the mosaics. To argue that they were is to make an analogous mistake of seeing adaptations everywhere.

"What do you think, Govinda," Siddhartha once asked him as they were on their way to beg. "Do you think we have made any progress? Have we reached any of our targets?" Govinda answered, "We have learned things, and we continue to learn. You will be a great samana, Siddhartha. You have learned every exercise very quickly, and the old samanas have been amazed at you. One day, Siddhartha, you will be a holy man." Siddhartha said, "That is not how I see it, my friend. All that I have learned so far I could have learned much faster and much easier in any bar where the whores are, my friend, among all the cheats and the gamblers." Govinda said, "That is what you say, my friend, but you know that Siddhartha is not some cattle driver, and that a samana is not some drunkard. The drunk can numb his senses, he can find escape and rest for a short time, but then he comes back from his stupor and finds that all is as it was before.

He had no difficulty in talking with everyone, to live with everyone, to learn from everyone, but the easier this was the more he became aware that there was something that separated him from them, and that was because he had been a samana. He saw how people lived their lives in a way that was like children or animals, something he both loved and despised. He saw their strivings, saw their sufferings and saw them turn grey about things that seemed to him not worth that price, about money, about petty pleasures, matters of petty honour, he saw them shouting and insulting each other, he saw them lamenting for pains which a samana would merely smile at, and for losses which a samana does not feel.

His Self had crept into this priesthood, into this pride, into this spirituality, it sat firmly there and grew while Siddhartha thought he was destroying it with fasting and penitence. Now he could see it, and he saw that the secret voice had been right, that no teacher could ever have removed this Self. That is why he had had to go out into the world, to lose himself in fun and power and women and money, had had to be a businessman, a gambler, a drinker and to be greedy, till the priest and the samana within him were dead. That is why he had had to continue to endure these years of loathsomeness, to bear the disgust, the emptiness, the meaninglessness, of a life that was lost and barren, right till the end, till the bitter doubt, till Siddhartha the sybarite, Siddhartha the greedy, was even ready to die. He did die, a new Siddhartha awoke from that sleep. Even he would grow old, even he would have to die one day, Siddhartha was impermanent, every form was impermanent.

I have had many such thoughts, but I would find it very hard to tell you about them. Govinda, listen, here is one of the thoughts that I have found: wisdom cannot be taught. If a wise man tries to teach wisdom it will always sound like folly." "Are you joking now?" Govinda asked. "I am not joking. I am saying what I have found. Knowledge can be taught, but not wisdom.

When the noble Gotama spoke of the world in his teachings he had to divide it into sansara and nirvana, into delusion and truth, into suffering and liberation. He who wishes to be a teacher has no choice in the matter, there is no other path for him to follow. The world itself, though, that which exists around us and within us, is never one sided. It is never a person, never an act, never the whole of sansara and never the whole of nirvana, and a person is never entirely holy and never entirely sinful. It does seem so because we are subjected to delusion and believe that time is something real. Time is not real, Govinda, that is something I have experienced many times. And if time is not real then the gap that seems to lie between the world and eternity, between suffering and being blessed, between evil and good, is also just delusion."

Now with our Steppenwolf it was so that in his conscious life he lived now as a wolf, now as a man, as indeed the case is with all mixed beings. But, when he was a wolf, the man in him lay in ambush, ever on the watch to interfere and condemn, while at those times that he was man the wolf did just the same. For example, if Harry, as man, had a beautiful thought, felt a fine and noble emotion, or performed a so-called good act, then the wolf bared his teeth at him and laughed and showed him with bitter scorn how laughable this whole pantomime was in the eyes of a beast, of a wolf who knew well enough in his heart what suited him, namely, to trot alone over the Steppes and now and then to gorge himself with blood or to pursue a female wolf. Then, wolfishly seen, all human activities became horribly absurd and misplaced, stupid and vain. But it was exactly the same when Harry felt and behaved as a wolf and showed others his teeth and felt hatred and enmity against all human beings and their lying and degenerate manners and customs. For then the human part of him lay in ambush and watched the wolf, called him brute and beast, and spoiled and embittered for him all pleasure in his simple and healthy and wild wolf’s being.

Suppose, then, that the gardener of this garden knew no other distinction than between edible and inedible, nine-tenths of this garden would be useless to him. He would pull up the most enchanting flowers and hew down the noblest trees and even regard them with a loathing and envious eye. This is what the Steppenwolf does with the thousand flowers of his soul. What does not stand classified as either man or wolf he does not see at all. And consider all that he imputes to “man”! All that is cowardly and apish, stupid and mean—while to the wolf, only because he has not succeeded in making himself its master, is set down all that is strong and noble.

But when I take hold of my mouthpiece and play a lively shimmy, whether the shimmy be good or bad, it will give people pleasure. It gets into their legs and into their blood. That’s the point and that alone. Look at the faces in a dance hall at the moment when the music strikes up after a longish pause, how eyes sparkle, legs twitch and faces begin to laugh. That is why one makes music.”

“You have a picture of life within you, a faith, a challenge, and you were ready for deeds and sufferings and sacrifices, and then you became aware by degrees that the world asked no deeds and no sacrifices of you whatever, and that life is no poem of heroism with heroic parts to play and so on, but a comfortable room where people are quite content with eating and drinking, coffee and knitting, cards and wireless. And whoever wants more and has got it in him—the heroic and the beautiful, and the reverence for the great poets or for the saints—is a fool and a Don Quixote. Good.

THE IMMORTALS Ever reeking from the vales of earth Ascends to us life’s fevered surge, Wealth’s excess, the rage of dearth, Smoke of death meals on the gallow’s verge; Greed without end, imprisoned air; Murderers’ hands, usurers’ hands, hands of prayer; Exhales in fœtid breath the human swarm Whipped on by fear and lust, blood raw, blood warm, Breathing blessedness and savage heats, Eating itself and spewing what it eats, Hatching war and lovely art, Decking out with idiot craze Bawdy houses while they blaze, Through the childish fair-time mart Weltering to its own decay In the glare of pleasure’s way, Rising for each newborn and then Sinking for each to dust again. But we above you ever more residing In the ether’s star translumined ice Know not day nor night nor time’s dividing, Wear nor age nor sex for our device. All your sins and anguish self-affrighting, Your murders and lascivious delighting Are to us but as a show Like the suns that circling go, Changing not our day for night; On your frenzied life we spy, And refresh ourselves thereafter With the stars in order fleeing; Our breath is winter; in our sight Fawns the dragon of the sky; Cool and unchanging is our eternal being, Cool and star bright is our eternal laughter.

Even while we were lost in the silent and deep preoccupation of our love and belonged more closely than ever we had to one another, my soul bid adieu to Maria, and took leave of all that she had meant to me. I had learned from her, once more before the end, to confide myself like a child to life’s surface play, to pursue a fleeting joy, and to be both child and beast in the innocence of sex, a state that (in earlier life) I had only known rarely and as an exception. The life of the senses and of sex had nearly always had for me the bitter accompaniment of guilt, the sweet but dread taste of forbidden fruit that puts a spiritual man on his guard. Now, Hermine and Maria had shown me this garden in its innocence, and I had been a guest there and thankfully. But it would soon be time to go on farther. It was too agreeable and too warm in this garden. It was my destiny to make another bid for the crown of life in the expiation of its endless guilt. An easy life, an easy love, an easy death—these were not for me.

GUIDANCE IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE PERSONALITY. SUCCESS GUARANTEED This seemed to me to be worth looking into and I went in at this door. I found myself in a quiet twilit room where a man with something like a large chessboard in front of him sat in Eastern fashion on the floor. At the first glance I thought it was friend Pablo. He wore at any rate a similar gorgeous silk jacket and had the same dark and shining eyes. “Are you Pablo?” I asked. “I am not anybody,” he replied amiably. “We have no names here and we are not anybody. I am a chess player. Do you wish for instruction in the building up of the personality?” “Yes, please.” “Then be so kind as to place a few dozen of your pieces at my disposal.” “My pieces—?” “Of the pieces into which you saw your so-called personality broken up. I can’t play without pieces.” He held a glass up to me and again I saw the unity of my personality broken up into many selves whose number seemed even to have increased

“The mistaken and unhappy notion that a man is an enduring unity is known to you. It is also known to you that man consists of a multitude of souls, of numerous selves. The separation of the unity of the personality into these numerous pieces passes for madness. Science has invented the name schizomania for it. Science is in this so far right as no multiplicity may be dealt with unless there be a series, a certain order and grouping. It is wrong insofar as it holds that one only and binding and lifelong order is possible for the multiplicity of subordinate selves. This error of science has many unpleasant consequences, and the single advantage of simplifying the work of the state-appointed pastors and masters and saving them the labors of original thought. In consequence of this error many persons pass for normal, and indeed for highly valuable members of society, who are incurably mad; and many, on the other hand, are looked upon as mad who are geniuses. Hence it is that we supplement the imperfect psychology of science by the conception that we call the art of building up the soul. We demonstrate to anyone whose soul has fallen to pieces that he can rearrange these pieces of a previous self in what order he pleases, and so attain to an endless multiplicity of moves in the game of life. As the playwright shapes a drama from a handful of characters, so do we from the pieces of the disintegrated self build up ever new groups, with ever new interplay and suspense, and new situations that are eternally inexhaustible. Look!”

“Gentlemen, there stands before you Harry Haller, accused and found guilty of the willful misuse of our Magic Theater. Haller has not alone insulted the majesty of art in that he confounded our beautiful picture gallery with so-called reality and stabbed to death the reflection of a girl with the reflection of a knife; he has in addition displayed the intention of using our theater as a mechanism of suicide and shown himself devoid of humor. Wherefore we condemn Haller to eternal life and we suspend for twelve hours his permit to enter our theater. The penalty also of being laughed out of court may not be remitted. Gentlemen, all together, one-two-three!” On the word “three” all who were present broke into one simultaneous peal of laughter, a laughter in full chorus, a frightful laughter of the other world that is scarcely to be borne by the ears of men.

Even though it was the most stunning location they had seen, its original homestead was in disrepair, so besides buying the land they would also have to build a new house, and that too became a source of added distractions.

And here’s a story you can hardly believe, but it’s true, and it’s funny and it’s beautiful. There was a family of twelve and they were forced off the land. They had no car. They built a trailer out of junk and loaded it with their possessions. They pulled it to the side of 66 and waited. And pretty soon a sedan picked them up. Five of them rode in the sedan and seven on the trailer, and a dog on the trailer. They got to California in two jumps. The man who pulled them fed them. And that’s true. But how can such courage be, and such faith in their own species? Very few things would teach such faith.

One man, one family driven from the land; this rusty car creaking along the highway to the west. I lost my land, a single tractor took my land. I am alone and I am bewildered. And in the night one family camps in a ditch and another family pulls in and the tents come out. The two men squat on their hams and the women and children listen. Here is the node, you who hate change and fear revolution. Keep these two squatting men apart; make them hate, fear, suspect each other. Here is the anlage of the thing you fear. This is the zygote. For here “I lost my land” is changed; a cell is split and from its splitting grows the thing you hate—“We lost our land.” The danger is here, for two men are not as lonely and perplexed as one. And from this first “we” there grows a still more dangerous thing: “I have a little food” plus “I have none.” If from this problem the sum is “We have a little food,” the thing is on its way, the movement has direction. Only a little multiplication now, and this land, this tractor are ours. The two men squatting in a ditch, the little fire, the sidemeat stewing in a single pot, the silent, stone-eyed women; behind, the children listening with their souls to words their minds do not understand. The night draws down. The baby has a cold. Here, take this blanket. It’s wool. It was my mother’s blanket—take it for the baby. This is the thing to bomb. This is the beginning—from “I” to “we.”

Only much later did I ascertain that we could not possibly have met until that morning. In any case, he had assumed for himself the role of uncle, continually smiling at me, patting my shoulder, nudging me and winking. Once he offered me a cup of tea, saying: ‘Now, Christopher, this will cheer you up,’ and had bent right down to peer at me as I had taken it. After that came more murmuring and conferring around the room. Then Mr Anderson appeared in front of me again and said:  ‘So then, Christopher. It’s all decided. This is Colonel Chamberlain. He’s most kindly agreed to see you safe to England.’  I remember at this point a hush descending over the room. In fact, my impression was that all the adults shrank back until they were lining the walls like spectators. Mr Anderson too withdrew with a final encouraging smile. It was then that I first laid eyes on Colonel Chamberlain. He came up to me slowly, bent down to look into my face, then held out his hand. I had a feeling I should stand up to shake it, but he had thrust it out so quickly, and I had felt so fixed to that chair, that I had grasped his hand still sitting. Then I remember him saying:  ‘My poor lad. First your father. Now your mother. Must feel like the whole world’s

My feeling is that she is thinking of herself as much as of me when she talks of a sense of mission, and the futility of attempting to evade it. Perhaps there are those who are able to go about their lives unfettered by such concerns. But for those like us, our fate is to face the world as orphans, chasing through long years the shadows of vanished parents. There is nothing for it but to try and see through our missions to the end, as best we can, for until we do so, we will be permitted no calm.

Of course, we’re very near it just now’ – she glanced up at the roof – ‘but in practical terms, that doesn’t mean very much because of the wall.’ ‘This is quite ridiculous!’ I had lost all patience. ‘I’ll find my own way. You’re obviously quite unable to appreciate that a person might be very busy, working on a tight schedule, and simply can’t afford to dawdle about the town for hours. In fact, if I may say so, this wall is quite typical of this town. Utterly preposterous obstacles everywhere. And what do you do? Do you all get annoyed? Do you demand it’s pulled down immediately so that people can go about their business? No, you put up with it for the best part of a century. You make postcards of it and believe it’s charming.

Hobby, schmobby, my mother would say. You don’t have to make excuses to me. Once upon a time you wouldn’t have been allowed to have such a hobby, they’d have called you queer. Now, Mother, I would say. Let’s not get into an argument about nothing. Nothing, she’d say bitterly. You call it nothing. You don’t understand, do you. You don’t understand at all what I’m talking about. Sometimes she would cry. I was so lonely, she’d say. You have no idea how lonely I was. And I had friends, I was a lucky one, but I was lonely anyway. I admired my mother in some ways, although things between us were never easy. She expected too much from me, I felt. She expected me to vindicate her life for her, and the choices she’d made. I didn’t want to live my life on her terms. I didn’t want to be the model offspring, the incarnation of her ideas. We used to fight about that. I am not your justification for existence, I said to her once. I want her back. I want everything back, the way it was. But there is no point to it, this wanting.

There there, she’d say, as he woke from a nightmare. Things are so hard for you. All this she would have believed, because otherwise how could she have kept on living? She was very ordinary, under that beauty. She believed in decency, she was nice to the Jewish maid, or nice enough, nicer than she needed to be. Several days after this interview with her was filmed, she killed herself. It said that, right on television. Nobody asked her whether or not she had loved him.

Uczono nas tutaj, że świat da się opisać, a nawet wyjaśnić za pomocą prostych odpowiedzi na inteligentne pytania. Że w swej istocie jest bezwładny i martwy, że rządzą nim dość proste prawa, które należy wyjaśnić i podać – najlepiej wykorzystując diagram. Domagano się od nas eksperymentów. Formułowania hipotez. Weryfikowania. Wprowadzano nas w tajemnice statystyki, wierząc, że za jej pomocą można doskonale opisać wszelkie prawidłowości świata – że 90 procent jest bardziej znaczące niż pięć. Lecz dziś wiem jedno: ten, kto szuka porządku, niech unika psychologii. Niechże się zdecyduje raczej na fizjologię czy teologię, będzie miał przynajmniej solidne oparcie – albo w materii, albo w duchu; nie pośliźnie się na psychice.

Gdzie się podziały te dwa tygodnie we Francji, które dziś dają się ścisnąć do zaledwie kilku wspomnień – nagłego uderzenia głodu pod murami średniowiecznego miasta i mgnienia wieczoru w knajpce pod dachem obrośniętym winoroślą. Co się stało z Norwegią?

Dla psychologii podróżnej nie są to sprawy leżące w centrum zainteresowań, są drugorzędne. Chcąc opisać człowieka przekonująco, możemy to tylko uczynić, umieszczając go w jakimś ruchu, skądś – dokądś. Fakt powstawania tak wielu nieprzekonujących opisów człowieka stabilnego, stałego, wydaje się kwestionować istnienie „ja” rozumianego nierelacyjnie. To sprawia, że od jakiegoś czasu w psychologii podróżnej pojawiają się pewne idee supremacyjne głoszące, iż nie może istnieć inna psychologia niż psychologia podróżna.

Czytając jego notatki, należy więc pamiętać, że Filip Verheyen był człowiekiem nieustannie cierpiącym i nie znającym przyczyny swojego bólu. Miejmy to na uwadze, gdy będziemy czytać jego słowa: „Dlaczego mnie boli? Czy dlatego, że – jak mówi ten szlifierz i może tylko w tym się nie myli – w istocie ciało i dusza są częścią czegoś większego i wspólnego, stanami tej samej substancji, jak woda, która może być zarówno płynem, jak i ciałem stałym. Dlaczego mnie boli to, co nie istnieje? Dlaczego odczuwam brak, czuję nieobecność? Czy może jesteśmy skazani na całość i każde pokawałkowanie, poćwiartowanie, będzie tylko pozorem, zdarzy się na powierzchni, pod spodem zaś plan pozostanie nienaruszony i niezmienny? Czy najmniejszy nawet fragment nadal nie należy do całości? Gdy świat jak wielka szklana kula spada i rozbija się na miliony części – czyż nadal w tym czymś wielkim, potężnym i nieskończonym nie pozostaje całością? Czy mój ból to Bóg? Moje życie spędziłem w podroży, podróżowałem do własnego ciała, do własnej odciętej kończyny. Sporządziłem najdokładniejsze mapy. Rozebrałem badaną rzecz według najlepszej metodologii na czynniki najpierwsze. Zliczyłem mięśnie, ścięgna, nerwy i naczynia krwionośne. Używałem do tego własnych oczu, ale wspierałem się także bystrzejszym wzrokiem mikroskopu. Wydaje mi się, że nie pominąłem żadnej najmniejszej części. Dziś mogę zadać sobie to pytanie: czego szukałem?”

Co mówiła zakutana biegunka Kiwaj się, ruszaj się, ruszaj. Tylko tak mu umkniesz. Ten, kto rządzi światem, nie ma władzy nad ruchem i wie, że nasze ciało w ruchu jest święte, tylko wtedy mu uciekasz, kiedy się poruszasz.

Więc ruszaj się, kiwaj, kołysz, idź, biegnij, uciekaj, gdy tylko się zapomnisz i staniesz, pochwycą cię jego wielkie ręce, zamienią cię w kukiełkę, owieje cię jego oddech, cuchnący dymem i spalinami, i wielkimi śmietniskami za miastem. On zamieni twoją barwną duszę w małą płaską duszyczkę, wyciętą z papieru, z gazety, i będzie ci groził ogniem, chorobą i wojną, będzie cię straszył, aż stracisz spokój i przestaniesz spać. Oznaczy cię i wpisze w swoje rejestry, da ci dokument tego upadku. Zajmie ci myśli nieważnymi rzeczami, co kupić, a co sprzedać, gdzie taniej, a gdzie drożej. Będziesz się odtąd martwić drobiazgami – ceną benzyny i jak ona wpłynie na spłatę kredytu.

W radiu podają prognozę pogody, że będzie padać. Tak i właśnie zaczyna padać, jakby krople deszczu czekały w pogotowiu na wypowiedziane w radiu zaklęcie; ruszają wycieraczki. I nagle coś się zmienia. Nie chodzi o pogodę, o deszcz, o widok przed samochodem, ale w jednej chwili widzi wszystko inaczej. Ma wrażenie, że zdjął ciemne okulary albo wycieraczki starły coś więcej niż zwykły miejski kurz. Robi mu się gorąco i mimowolnie spuszcza nogę z gazu. Trąbią na niego. Bierze się w garść i nadgania tak, żeby być tuż za czarnym volkswagenem. Zaczynają pocić mu się ręce. Najchętniej zjechałby na bok, ale nie ma gdzie, musi jechać. Widzi z przeraźliwą jasnością – że cała dobrze znana droga jest pełna krzykliwych znaków. To informacje przeznaczone tylko dla niego. Kółka na jednej nodze, żółte trójkąty, niebieskie kwadraty, zielone i białe tablice, strzałki, wskazówki. Światła. Linie wymalowane na asfalcie, tablice informacyjne, ostrzeżenia, przypomnienia. Uśmiech z billboardu, też istotny. Widział je dzisiaj rano, ale wtedy jeszcze nic nie mówiły, rano mógł je zignorować, teraz już mu się to nie uda. Przemawiają do niego cichym, kategorycznym tonem, jest ich o wiele więcej, właściwie nie ma wolnej od nich przestrzeni. Szyldy na sklepach, reklamy, symbole poczty, apteki, banku, lizak wzniesiony przez przedszkolankę, która przeprowadza dzieci przez pasy, znak idzie przez znak, w poprzek znaku, znak wskazujący inny znak – trochę dalej, znak podejmowany przez inny znak, przekazywany dalej, zmowa znaków, sieć znaków, porozumienie znaków poza jego plecami. Nic nie jest niewinne i bez znaczenia, wielka nieskończona łamigłówka. W panice szuka miejsca do zaparkowania, musi zamknąć oczy, bo zwariuje. Co mu się stało? Zaczyna drżeć. Z ulgą znajduje przystanek autobusowy i tam zjeżdża. Stara się opanować. Myśli, że może miał wylew. Boi się spojrzeć wokół. Może odkrył jakiś rodzaj widzenia, inny Punkt Widzenia, dużymi literami, wszystko dużymi literami. Oddech po chwili wraca do normy, ale ręce drżą nadal. Zapala papierosa, o tak, przytruje go trochę nikotyną, otumani dymem, okadzi z demonów. Ale wie już, że nie pojedzie dalej, nie dałby rady z tą nową wiedzą, która go przytłacza. Dyszy z głową opartą o kierownicę. Ustawia samochód na chodniku, na pewno wlepią mu mandat, i ostrożnie wychodzi. Asfaltowa jezdnia wydaje mu się teraz grząska.

Jestem Rozwinęłam się. Na początku, budząc się w obcych miejscach, myślałam, że jestem w domu. Dopiero po chwili rozpoznawałam nieznane szczegóły, odsłonięte teraz przez światło dnia. Ciężkie hotelowe zasłony, bryła telewizora, moja rozbebeszona walizka, białe, schludnie złożone ręczniki. Nowe miejsce ukazywało się zza firanek, zakwefione, tajemnicze, najczęściej białokremowe lub żółte od ulicznych latarni. Potem jednak weszłam w fazę, którą psychologowie podróżni nazywają „Nie wiem, gdzie jestem”. Budziłam się zupełnie zdezorientowana. Usiłowałam – jak alkoholik w ciągu – przypomnieć sobie, co robiłam poprzedniego wieczoru, gdzie byłam, dokąd wiodły mnie drogi, odtwarzałam szczegół po szczególe, aby odczytać teraz i tutaj. A im dłużej trwała ta specjalna procedura, tym większa pojawiała się panika, nieprzyjemny stan, podobny do choroby błędnika, utraty podstawowej równowagi, zbierający na mdłości. Gdzie ja, do cholery, jestem. Lecz detale świata są litościwe i w końcu naprowadzały mnie na właściwy trop. Jestem w M. Jestem w B. To jest hotel, a to mieszkanie mojej przyjaciółki, pokój gościnny u rodziny N. Kanapa u znajomych. Takie przebudzenie było jak podstemplowanie biletu na dalszą drogę. Następny jest jednak etap trzeci, jak mówi psychologia podróżna, wieńczący, kluczowy, etap, który stanowi ostateczny cel; dokądkolwiek byśmy podróżowali, podróżujemy zawsze w jego kierunku. „Nieważne, gdzie jestem”, wszystko jedno, gdzie jestem. Jestem.

Sandberg often livestreams on Facebook interviews with famous or brave women. At the end she asks a question emblazoned on posters all over Facebook’s campus: what would you do if you weren’t afraid? As she reaches for her small Facebook-branded notebook and her smartphone, in a case emblazoned with ‘Ban Bossy’, I finish by putting her own question to her. Speaking quietly, she comes in closer. ‘I think I wrote this book because it is personal and it is very open,’ she says, tears welling. ‘I want some good from the tragedy, just something good.’ Then she snaps back to composed, hugs me again and leaves.

But here’s an interesting quirk: countries with genderless languages (such as Hungarian and Finnish) are not the most equal. Instead, that honour belongs to a third group, countries with ‘natural gender languages’ such as English. These languages allow gender to be marked (female teacher, male nurse) but largely don’t encode it into the words themselves. The study authors suggested that if you can’t mark gender in any way you can’t ‘correct’ the hidden bias in a language by emphasising ‘women’s presence in the world’. In short: because men go without saying, it matters when women literally can’t get said at all.

Journalist Sarah Ditum has little time for this argument. ‘Come on now,’ she chided in a column. ‘You’ve played games as a blue hedgehog. As a cybernetically augmented space marine. As a sodding dragon-tamer. […B]ut the idea that women can be protagonists with an inner life and an active nature is somehow beyond your imaginative capacities?’70 Ditum is of course technically right. It should be easier to imagine yourself as a woman than as a blue hedgehog. But on the other hand she’s also wrong, because that blue hedgehog has one particularly important similarity with male players, even more so than species alignment, and that is that Sonic the hedgehog is male. We know this because he isn’t pink, he doesn’t have a bow in his hair, and he doesn’t simper. He is the standard, unmarked gender, not the atypical one.

A survey of US firms found that 95% used performance evaluations in 2002 (compared to 45% in 1971) and 90% had a merit-based pay plan in place.6 The problem is, there is little evidence that these approaches actually work. In fact, there is strong evidence that they don’t. An analysis of 248 performance reviews collected from a variety of US-based tech companies found that women receive negative personality criticism that men simply don’t.7 Women are told to watch their tone, to step back. They are called bossy, abrasive, strident, aggressive, emotional and irrational. Out of all these words, only aggressive appeared in men’s reviews at all – ‘twice with an exhortation to be more of it’. More damningly, several studies of performance-related bonuses or salary increases have found that white men are rewarded at a higher rate than equally performing women and ethnic minorities, with one study of a financial corporation uncovering a 25% difference in performance-based bonuses between women and men in the same job.8

But if you aren’t aware of how those biases operate, if you aren’t collecting data and taking a little time to produce evidence-based processes, you will continue to blindly perpetuate old injustices. And so by not considering the ways in which women’s lives differ from men’s, both on and offline, Gild’s coders inadvertently created an algorithm with a hidden bias against women.

The trouble with traditional stoves is that they give off extremely toxic fumes. A woman cooking on a traditional stove in an unventilated room is exposed to the equivalent of more than a hundred cigarettes a day.33 According to a 2016 paper, in countries from Peru to Nigeria, toxic fumes from stoves are between twenty and a hundred times above World Health Organization guideline limits,34 and globally they cause three times more deaths (2.9 million)35 every year than malaria.36 This is all made worse by the inefficiency of traditional stoves: women who cook on them are exposed to these fumes for three to seven hours a day,37 meaning that, worldwide, indoor air pollution is the single largest environmental risk factor for female mortality and the leading killer of children under the age of five.38 Indoor air pollution is also the eighth-leading contributor to the overall global disease burden, causing respiratory and cardiovascular damage, as well as increased susceptibility to infectious illnesses such as tuberculosis and lung cancer.39 However, as is so often the case with health problems that mainly affect women, ‘these adverse health effects have not been studied in an integrated and scientifically rigorous manner’.40

But there are a number of data gaps. For a start, this dummy is only tested in the passenger seat, so we have no data at all for how a female driver would be affected – something of an issue you would think, given women’s ‘out of position’ driving position. And secondly, this female dummy is not really female. It is just a scaled-down male dummy.

‘Everyone acknowledges that there is economic value in that work, it’s just not part of ‘the economy’,’ says Coyle. This was not a mere oversight: it was a deliberate decision, following a fairly vigorous debate. ‘The omission of unpaid services of housewives from national income computation distorts the picture’, wrote economist Paul Studenski in his classic 1958 text The Income of Nations. In principle, he concluded, ‘unpaid work in the home should be included in GDP’. But principles are man-made, and so ‘after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing’, and much debate over how you would measure and value unpaid household services ‘it was decided’, says Coyle, ‘that this would be too big a task in terms of collecting the data’.

In 2014, 41% of mothers of children under four were employed full-time, compared to 82% of childless women and 84% of fathers.74 This sex disparity is partly due to societal expectations (enshrined in law via unequal maternity- and paternity-leave allowances) that the mother be the primary carer. But it’s also because of the gender pay gap: for many heterosexual couples it makes financial sense for the woman to be the one to reduce her working hours, because she tends to be the one who is earning less.

We like to think that the unpaid work women do is just about individual women caring for their individual family members to their own individual benefit. It isn’t. Women’s unpaid work is work that society depends on, and it is work from which society as a whole benefits. When the government cuts public services that we all pay for with our taxes, demand for those services doesn’t suddenly cease. The work is simply transferred onto women, with all the attendant negative impacts on female paid labour-participation rates, and GDP. And so the unpaid work that women do isn’t simply a matter of ‘choice’. It is built into the system we have created – and it could just as easily be built out of it. We just need the will to start collecting the data, and then designing our economy around reality rather than a male-biased confection.

UNSCR 1325 ‘urges all actors to increase the participation of women and incorporate gender perspectives in all United Nations peace and security efforts’. Following ‘decades of lobbying’ from women’s rights activists,7 this landmark resolution was passed in 2000. But eighteen years on, further progress has been minimal. For a start, the available data is scant8 – which in itself is suggestive about the seriousness with which this resolution is taken. As for what data does exist, it’s hardly encouraging. Only two women have ever served as chief negotiators and only one woman has ever signed a final peace accord as chief negotiator.9 Funding for the implementation of policies related to women’s rights in post-conflict contexts remains ‘inadequate’,10 as does progress on the basic requirement of including women in all delegations.11 Even where women are included, they remain in the minority and excluded from positions of power, and in some areas, we have even regressed: in 2016 only half of that year’s signed peace agreements contained gender-specific provisions, compared to 70% of signed peace agreements in 2015. In the June 2017 Afghanistan peace talks, women made up 6% of negotiators, 0% of mediators, and 0% of signatories. Causal data for the sudden reversal between 2016 and 2017 is not available, but a clue comes courtesy of a participant at an off-the-record round table on women, peace and security at the International Peace Institute in New York in 2014. ‘The UN and other powerbrokers succumb to requests not to have women in the room,’ the participant claimed. ‘When the local government says “We don’t want women,” the international community compromises and says “OK.”’12 As in post-disaster contexts, the reasoning given varies (cultural sensitivities; including women would delay the negotiations; women can be included after an agreement has been reached) but they all boil down to the same line that’s been used to fob women off for centuries: we’ll get to you after the revolution.

Domestic violence against women increases when conflict breaks out. In fact, it is more prevalent than conflict-related sexual violence.3 To put this in context, an estimated 60,000 women were raped in the three-month Bosnian conflict and up to 250,000 in the hundred-day Rwandan genocide. UN agencies estimate that more than 60,000 women were raped during the civil war in Sierra Leone (1991–2002); more than 40,000 in Liberia (1989–2003); and at least 200,000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1998.4 Because of data gaps (apart from anything else, there is often no one for women to report to), the real figures in all these conflicts are likely to have been much higher.

Violence is one way to silence people, to deny their voice and their credibility, to assert your right to control over their right to exist. About three women a day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses in this country. It’s one of the main causes of death for pregnant women in the United States. At the heart of the struggle of feminism to give rape, date rape, marital rape, domestic violence, and workplace sexual harassment legal standing as crimes has been the necessity of making women credible and audible.

That made clear to me the continuum that stretches from minor social misery to violent silencing and violent death (and I think we would understand misogyny and violence against women even better if we looked at the abuse of power as a whole rather than treating domestic violence separately from rape and murder and harrassment and intimidation, online and at home and in the workplace and in the streets; seen together, the pattern is clear).

As I began writing this essay, I picked up a book on wilderness survival by Laurence Gonzalez and found in it this telling sentence: “The plan, a memory of the future, tries on reality to see if it fits.” His point is that when the two seem incompatible we often hang onto the plan, ignore the warnings reality offers us, and so plunge into trouble. Afraid of the darkness of the unknown, the spaces in which we see only dimly, we often choose the darkness of closed eyes, of obliviousness. Gonzalez adds, “Researchers point out that people tend to take any information as confirmation of their mental models. We are by nature optimists, if optimism means that we believe we see the world as it is. And under the influence of a plan, it’s easy to see what we want to see.” It’s the job of writers and explorers to see more, to travel light when it comes to preconception, to go into the dark with their eyes open.

Public space, urban space, which serves at other times the purposes of the citizen, the member of society establishing contact with other members, is here the space in which to disappear from the bonds and binds of individual identity. Woolf is celebrating getting lost, not literally lost as in not knowing how to find your way, but lost as in open to the unknown, and the way that physical space can provide psychic space.

The conversation changed. The term “rape culture” started to circulate widely. It insists that a wider culture generates individual crimes and that both must be addressed—and can be. The phrase had first been used by feminists in the 1970s, but what put it into general circulation, evidence suggests, were the Slutwalks that began in 2011 as a protest against victim-blaming. A Toronto policeman giving a safety talk at a university told female students not to dress like sluts. Soon after, Slutwalks became an international phenomenon, of mostly young, often sexily dressed women taking back public space (rather like the Take Back the Night walks of the 1980s, but with more lipstick and less clothing). Young feminists are a thrilling phenomenon: smart, bold, funny defenders of rights and claimers of space—and changers of the conversation. That policeman’s “slut” comment was part of the emphasis colleges have put on telling female students how to box themselves in safely—don’t go here, don’t do that—rather than telling male students not to rape: this is part of rape culture.

Fukuyama’s thesis that history has climaxed with liberal capitalism may have been widely derided, but it is accepted, even assumed, at the level of the cultural unconscious. It should be remembered, though, that even when Fukuyama advanced it, the idea that history had reached a ‘terminal beach’ was not merely triumphalist. Fukuyama warned that his radiant city would be haunted, but he thought its specters would be Nietzschean rather than Marxian. Some of Nietzsche’s most prescient pages are those in which he describes the ‘oversaturation of an age with history’. ‘It leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself, he wrote in Untimely Meditations, ‘and subsequently into the even more dangerous mood of cynicism’, in which ‘cosmopolitan fingering’, a detached spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement.

Capitalist ideology in general, Žižek maintains, consists precisely in the overvaluing of belief – in the sense of inner subjective attitude – at the expense of the beliefs we exhibit and externalize in our behavior. So long as we believe (in our hearts) that capitalism is bad, we are free to continue to participate in capitalist exchange. According to Žižek, capitalism in general relies on this structure of disavowal. We believe that money is only a meaningless token of no intrinsic worth, yet we act as if it has a holy value. Moreover, this behavior precisely depends upon the prior disavowal – we are able to fetishize money in our actions only because we have already taken an ironic distance towards money in our heads.

But Green issues are already a contested zone, already a site where politicization is being fought for. In what follows, I want to stress two other aporias in capitalist realism, which are not yet politicized to anything like the same degree. The first is mental health. Mental health, in fact, is a paradigm case of how capitalist realism operates. Capitalist realism insists on treating mental health as if it were a natural fact, like weather (but, then again, weather is no longer a natural fact so much as a political-economic effect). In the 1960s and 1970s, radical theory and politics (Laing, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, etc.) coalesced around extreme mental conditions such as schizophrenia, arguing, for instance, that madness was not a natural, but a political, category. But what is needed now is a politicization of much more common disorders. Indeed, it is their very commonness which is the issue: in Britain, depression is now the condition that is most treated by the NHS.

In his book The Selfish Capitalist, Oliver James has convincingly posited a correlation between rising rates of mental distress and the neoliberal mode of capitalism practiced in countries like Britain, the USA and Australia. In line with James’s claims, I want to argue that it is necessary to reframe the growing problem of stress (and distress) in capitalist societies. Instead of treating it as incumbent on individuals to resolve their own psychological distress, instead, that is, of accepting the vast privatization of stress that has taken place over the last thirty years, we need to ask: how has it become acceptable that so many people, and especially so many young people, are ill? The ‘mental health plague’ in capitalist societies would suggest that, instead of being the only social system that works, capitalism is inherently dysfunctional, and that the cost of it appearing to work is very high.

Many of the teenage students I encountered seemed to be in a state of what I would call depressive hedonia. Depression is usually characterized as a state of anhedonia, but the condition I’m referring to is constituted not by an inability to get pleasure so much as it by an inability to do anything else except pursue pleasure. There is a sense that ‘something is missing’ – but no appreciation that this mysterious, missing enjoyment can only be accessed beyond the pleasure principle. In large part this is a consequence of students’ ambiguous structural position, stranded between their old role as subjects of disciplinary institutions and their new status as consumers of services. In his crucial essay ‘Postscript on Societies of Control’, Deleuze distinguishes between the disciplinary societies described by Foucault, which were organized around the enclosed spaces of the factory, the school and the prison, and the new control societies, in which all institutions are embedded in a dispersed corporation.

The consequence of being hooked into the entertainment matrix is twitchy, agitated interpassivity, an inability to concentrate or focus. Students’ incapacity to connect current lack of focus with future failure, their inability to synthesize time into any coherent narrative, is symptomatic of more than mere demotivation. It is, in fact, eerily reminiscent of Jameson’s analysis in ‘Postmodernism and Consumer Society’. Jameson observed there that Lacan’s theory of schizophrenia offered a ‘suggestive aesthetic model’ for understanding the fragmenting of subjectivity in the face of the emerging entertainment-industrial complex. ‘With the breakdown of the signifying chain’, Jameson summarized, ‘the Lacanian schizophrenic is reduced to an experience of pure material signifiers, or, in other words, a series of pure and unrelated presents in time’. Jameson was writing in the late 1980s – i.e. the period in which most of my students were born. What we in the classroom are now facing is a generation born into that ahistorical, anti-mnemonic blip culture – a generation, that is to say, for whom time has always come ready-cut into digital micro-slices.

It is worth stressing that none of the students I taught had any legal obligation to be at college. They could leave if they wanted to. But the lack of any meaningful employment opportunities, together with cynical encouragement from government means that college seems to be the easier, safer option. Deleuze says that Control societies are based on debt rather than enclosure; but there is a way in which the current education system both indebts and encloses students. Pay for your own exploitation, the logic insists – get into debt so you can get the same McJob you could have walked into if you’d left school at sixteen…

In any case, resistance to the ‘new’ is not a cause that the left can or should rally around. Capital thought very carefully about how to break labor; yet there has still not yet been enough thought about what tactics will work against capital in conditions of post-Fordism, and what new language can be innovated to deal with those conditions. It is important to contest capitalism’s appropriation of ‘the new’, but to reclaim the ‘new’ can’t be a matter of adapting to the conditions in which we find ourselves –we’ve done that rather too well, and ‘successful adaptation’ is the strategy of managerialism par excellence.

The situation of the family in post-Fordist capitalism is contradictory, in precisely the way that traditional Marxism expected: capitalism requires the family (as an essential means of reproducing and caring for labor power; as a salve for the psychic wounds inflicted by anarchic social-economic conditions), even as it undermines it (denying parents time with children, putting intolerable stress on couples as they become the exclusive source of affective consolation for each other).

According to Marxist economist Christian Marazzi, the switch from Fordism to post-Fordism can be given a very specific date: October 6, 1979. It was on that date that the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 20 points, preparing the way for the ‘supply-side economics’ that would constitute the ‘economic reality’ in which we are now enmeshed. The rise in interest rates not only contained inflation, it made possible a new organization of the means of production and distribution. The ‘rigidity’ of the Fordist production line gave way to a new ‘flexibility’, a word that will send chills of recognition down the spine of every worker today. This flexibility was defined by a deregulation of Capital and labor, with the workforce being casualized (with an increasing number of workers employed on a temporary basis), and outsourced.

One such view prescribes and condones the sexual ordering of gender, maintaining that men who are men will be straight, women who are women will be straight. There is another set of views, Franke’s included, which offers a critique precisely of this form of gender regulation. There is thus a difference between sexist and feminist views on the relation between gender and sexuality: the sexist claims that a woman only exhibits her womanness in the act of heterosexual coitus in which her subordination becomes her pleasure (an essence emanates and is confirmed in the sexualized subordination of women); a feminist view argues that gender should be overthrown, eliminated, or rendered fatally ambiguous precisely because it is always a sign of subordination for women.

It is important for me to concede, however, that the performance of gender subversion can indicate nothing about sexuality or sexual practice. Gender can be rendered ambiguous without disturbing or reorienting normative sexuality at all. Sometimes gender ambiguity can operate precisely to contain or deflect non-normative sexual practice and thereby work to keep normative sexuality intact.5 Thus, no correlation can be drawn, for instance, between drag or transgender and sexual practice, and the distribution of hetero-, bi-, and homo-inclinations cannot be predictably mapped onto the travels of gender bending or changing.

In the first instance, then, the performativity of gender revolves around this metalepsis, the way in which the anticipation of a gendered essence produces that which it posits as outside itself.

But formulations that twist grammar or that implicitly call into question the subject-verb requirements of propositional sense are clearly irritating for some. They produce more work for their readers, and sometimes their readers are offended by such demands. Are those who are offended making a legitimate request for “plain speaking” or does their complaint emerge from a consumer expectation of intellectual life? Is there, perhaps, a value to be derived from such experiences of linguistic difficulty? If gender itself is naturalized through grammatical norms, as Monique Wittig has argued, then the alteration of gender at the most fundamental epistemic level will be conducted, in part, through contesting the grammar in which gender is given.

All of this subjected me to strong and scarring condemnation but, luckily, did not prevent me from pursuing pleasure and insisting on a legitimating recognition for my sexual life. It was difficult to bring this violence into view precisely because gender was so taken for granted at the same time that it was violently policed.

It would be a mistake to take it as the paradigm of subversive action or, indeed, as a model for political agency. The point is rather different.

To expose the foundational categories of sex, gender, and desire as effects of a specific formation of power requires a form of critical inquiry that Foucault, reformulating Nietzsche, designates as “genealogy.” A genealogical critique refuses to search for the origins of gender, the inner truth of female desire, a genuine or authentic sexual identity that repression has kept from view; rather, genealogy investigates the political stakes in designating as an origin and cause those identity categories that are in fact the effects of institutions, practices, discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin. The task of this inquiry is to center on—and decenter—such defining institutions: phallogocentrism and compulsory heterosexuality.

Compulsory heterosexuality and phallogocentrism are understood as regimes of power/discourse with often divergent ways of answering central question of gender discourse: How does language construct the categories of sex? Does “the feminine” resist representation within language? Is language understood as phallogocentric (Luce Irigaray’s question)? Is “the feminine” the only sex represented within a language that conflates the female and the sexual (Monique Wittig’s contention)? Where and how do compulsory heterosexuality and phallogocentrism converge? Where are the points of breakage between? How does language itself produce the fiction construction of “sex” that supports these various regimes of power? Within a language of presumptive heterosexuality, what sorts of continuities are assumed to exist among sex, gender, and desire? Are these terms discrete?

It is not enough to inquire into how women might become more fully represented in language and politics. Feminist critique ought also to understand how the category of “women,” the subject of feminism, is produced and restrained by the very structures of power through which emancipation is sought.

In a move that complicates the discussion further, Luce Irigaray argues that women constitute a paradox, if not a contradiction, within the discourse of identity itself. Women are the “sex” which is not “one.” Within a language pervasively masculinist, a phallogocentric language, women constitute the unrepresentable. In other words, women represent the sex that cannot be thought, a linguistic absence and opacity. Within a language that rests on univocal signification, the female sex constitutes the unconstrainable and undesignatable. In this sense, women are the sex which is not “one,” but multiple.16 In opposition to Beauvoir, for whom women are designated as the Other, Irigaray argues that both the subject and the Other are masculine mainstays of a closed phallogocentric signifying economy that achieves its totalizing goal through the exclusion of the feminine altogether. For Beauvoir, women are the negative of men, the lack against which masculine identity differentiates itself; for Irigaray, that particular dialectic constitutes a system that excludes an entirely different economy of signification. Women are not only represented falsely within the Sartrian frame of signifying-subject and signified-Other, but the falsity of the signification points out the entire structure of representation as inadequate. The sex which is not one, then, provides a point of departure for a criticism of hegemonic Western representation and of the metaphysics of substance that structures the very notion of the subject.

This relational or contextual point of view suggests that what the person “is,” and, indeed, what gender “is,” is always relative to the constructed relations in which it is determined.17 As a shifting and contextual phenomenon, gender does not denote a substantive being, but a relative point of convergence among culturally and historically specific sets of relations.

Irigaray would maintain, however, that the feminine “sex” is a point of linguistic absence, the impossibility of a grammatically denoted substance, and, hence, the point of view that exposes that substance as an abiding and foundational illusion of a masculinist discourse. This absence is not marked as such within the masculine signifying economy—a contention that reverses Beauvoir’s argument (and Wittig’s) that the female sex is marked, while the male sex is not.

For Irigaray, the female sex is not a “lack” or an “Other” that immanently and negatively defines the subject in its masculinity. On the contrary, the female sex eludes the very requirements of representation, for she is neither “Other” nor the “lack,” those categories remaining relative to the Sartrian subject, immanent to that phallogocentric scheme.

Gender is a complexity whose totality is permanently deferred, never fully what it is at any given juncture in time. An open coalition, then, will affirm identities that are alternately instituted and relinquished according to the purposes at hand; it will be an open assemblage that permits of multiple convergences and divergences without obedience to a normative telos of definitional closure.

The psychoanalytic critique succeeds in giving an account of the construction of “the subject”—and perhaps also the illusion of substance—within the matrix of normative gender relations. In her existential-materialist mode, Wittig presumes the subject, the person, to have a presocial and pregendered integrity. On the other hand, “the paternal Law” in Lacan, as well as the monologic mastery of phallogocentrism in Irigaray, bear the mark of a monotheistic singularity that is perhaps less unitary and culturally universal than the guiding structuralist assumptions of the account presume.

If there is something right in Beauvoir’s claim that one is not born, but rather becomes a woman, it follows that woman itself is a term in process, a becoming, a constructing that cannot rightfully be said to originate or to end. As an ongoing discursive practice, it is open to intervention and resignification.

That’s the standard way you cloak and protect power: you make it look mysterious and secret, above the ordinary person—otherwise why should anybody accept it? Well, they’re willing to accept it out of fear that some great enemies are about to destroy them, and because of that they’ll cede their authority to the Lord, or the King, or the President or something, just to protect themselves.

And with the decline of the traditional manufacturing industries in recent years, it’s getting worse, not better. As capital becomes more fluid and it becomes easier for corporations to move production to the Third World, why should they pay higher wages in Detroit when they can pay lower wages in Northern Mexico or the Philippines? And the result is, there’s even more pressure on the poorer part of the population here. And what’s in effect happened is they’ve been closed off into inner-city slums—where then all sorts of other pressures begin to attack them: drugs, gentrification, police repression, cutbacks in limited welfare programs, and so on. And all of these things contribute to creating a very authentic sense of hopelessness, and also to real anti-social behavior: crime. And the crime is mostly poor people preying on one another, the statistics show that very clearly—because the rich are locked away behind their barricades.29 You can see it very clearly when you drive through New York now: the differences in wealth are like San Salvador. I mean, I was giving a talk there a little while ago, and as you walk around it’s kind of dramatic: there are these castles, and there are guards at the gate, and a limousine drives up and the people go inside; inside I guess it’s very elegant and beautiful. But it’s like living in a feudal system, with a lot of wild barbarians outside—except if you’re rich, you don’t ever see them, you just move between your castle and your limousine. And if you’re poor, you’ve got no castle to protect you.

But the point is, if things ever really come to a crunch in the United States, this massive part of the population—I think it’s something like a third of the adult population by now—could be the basis for some kind of a fascist movement, readily. For example, if the country sinks deeply into a recession, a depoliticized population could very easily be mobilized into thinking it’s somebody else’s fault: “Why are our lives collapsing? There have to be bad guys out there doing something for things to be going so badly”—and the bad guys can be Jews, or homosexuals, or blacks, or Communists, whatever you pick. If you can whip people into irrational frenzies like that, they can be extremely dangerous: that’s what 1930s Fascism came from, and something like that could very easily happen here.

Would you enlarge on that, and tell us what your thoughts are on the future of that kind of government? I think it has a big future, myself—in fact, I think the Reagan administration was sort of a peek into the future. It’s a very natural move. Imagine yourself working in some public relations office where your job is to help corporations make sure that the annoying public does not get in the way of policy-making. Here’s a brilliant thought that nobody ever had before, so far as I know: let’s make elections completely symbolic activities. The population can keep voting, we’ll give them all the business, they’ll have electoral campaigns, all the hoopla, two candidates, eight candidates—but the people they’re voting for will then just be expected to read off a teleprompter and they won’t be expected to know anything except what somebody tells them, and maybe not even that.

Actually, the Nuremberg trials are worth thinking about. The Nazis were something unique, granted. But if you take a look at the Nuremberg trials, they were very cynical. The operational criterion for what counted as a war crime at Nuremberg was a criminal act that the West didn’t do: in other words, it was considered a legitimate defense if you could show that the Americans and the British did the same thing. That’s actually true. So part of the defense of the German submarine commander Admiral Doenitz was to call an American submarine commander, Admiral Nimitz, to testify that the Americans did the same thing—that’s a defense. Bombing of urban areas was not considered a war crime at Nuremberg; reason is, the West did more of it than the Germans. And this is all stated straight out—like if you read the book by Telford Taylor, the American prosecutor at the trials, this is the way he describes it; he’s very positive about the whole thing.43 If the West had done it, it wasn’t a crime; it was only a crime if the Germans had done it and we hadn’t. I mean, it’s true there were plenty of such things, but still there’s something pretty cynical about it.

If nationalization of industry puts production into the hands of a state bureaucracy or some sort of Leninist-style vanguard party, then you’d just have another system of exploitation, in my view. On the other hand, if nationalization of industry was based on actual popular control over industry—workers’ control over factories, community control, with the groups maybe federated together and so on—then that would be a different story.

If you take an economics course, they’ll teach you, correctly, that if the government spends n dollars to stimulate the economy, it doesn’t really matter what it’s spent on: they can build jet planes, they can bury it in the sand and get people to dig for it, they can build roads and houses, they can do all sorts of things—in terms of stimulating the economy, the economic effects are not all that different.2 In fact, it’s perfectly likely that military spending is actually a less efficient stimulus than social spending, for all kinds of reasons. But the problem is, spending for civilian purposes has negative side effects. For one thing, it interferes with managerial prerogatives. The money that’s funneled through the Pentagon system is just a straight gift to the corporate manager, it’s like saying, “I’ll buy anything you produce, and I’ll pay for the research and development, and if you can make any profits, fine.” From the point of view of the corporate manager, that’s optimal. But if the government started producing anything that business might be able to sell directly to the commercial market, then it would be interfering with corporate profit-making. Production of waste—of expensive, useless machinery—is not an interference: nobody else is going to produce B-2 bombers, right? So that’s one point.

You have to bear in mind what happened there. Nobody here cares, so nobody studies it carefully, but over the course of the Indochina wars the number of people killed was maybe four million or more. [“Indochina” was the French colony comprising the area of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; the United States attacked each of those countries in the 1960s and Seventies.] Tens of millions of others were displaced from their homes.

As a matter of fact, if you really want to do a serious media critique right across the board, these are the types of things which occupy most of the media, after all—most of it isn’t shaping the news about El Salvador for politically articulate people, it’s diverting the general population from things that really matter.

It included the straight Gestapo-style assassination of a Black Panther leader; it included organizing race riots in an effort to destroy the black movements; it included attacks on the American Indian Movement, on the women’s movement, you name it. It included fifteen years of F.B.I. disruption of the Socialist Workers Party—that meant regular F.B.I. burglaries, stealing membership lists and using them to threaten people, going to businesses and getting members fired from their jobs, and so on.33 Well, that fact alone—the fact that for fifteen years the F.B.I. had been burglarizing and trying to undermine a legal political party—is already vastly more important than the fact that a bunch of Keystone Kops broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters one time.

Or take a look at the Nixon administration’s famous “Enemies List,” which came out in the course of Watergate [exposed in 1973, the document named 208 Americans from various professions under the title “Opponents list and political enemies project”]. You’ve heard of that, but did you hear about the assassination of Fred Hampton? No. Nothing ever happened to any of the people who were on the Enemies List, which I know perfectly well, because I was on it—and it wasn’t because I was on it that it made the front pages. But the F.B.I. and the Chicago police assassinated a Black Panther leader as he lay in his bed one night during the Nixon administration [on December 4, 1969]. Well, if the press had any integrity at all, if the Washington Post had any integrity, what they would have said is, “Watergate is totally insignificant and innocuous, who cares about any of that in comparison with these other things.” But that’s not what happened, obviously. And that just shows again, very dramatically, how the press is lined up with power.

In fact, in this respect I think Nixon was treated extremely unfairly. I mean, there were real crimes of the Nixon administration, and he should have been tried—but not for any of the Watergate business. Take the bombing of Cambodia, for instance: the bombing of Cambodia was infinitely worse than anything that came up in the Watergate hearings—this thing they call the “secret bombing” of Cambodia, which was “secret” because the press didn’t talk about what they knew.34 The U.S. killed maybe a couple hundred thousand people in Cambodia, they devastated a peasant society.35 The bombing of Cambodia did not even appear in Nixon’s Articles of Impeachment. It was raised in the Senate hearings, but only in one interesting respect—the question that was raised was, why hadn’t Nixon informed Congress? It wasn’t, why did you carry out one of the most intense bombings in history in densely populated areas of a peasant country, killing maybe 150,000 people? That never came up.

The policy that won out was what he called “stalemate”: keep things the way they are, maintain the system of Israeli oppression. And there was a good reason for that, it wasn’t just out of the blue: having an embattled, militaristic Israel is an important part of how we rule the world. Basically the United States doesn’t give a damn about Israel: if it goes down the drain, U.S. planners don’t care one way or another, there’s no moral obligation or anything else. But what they do care about is control of the enormous oil resources of the Middle East.

In fact, the World Bank gave its own analysis of the success of the Soviet development model. The World Bank is not a radical outfit, as I’m sure you realize, but in 1990 it described Russia and China as “relatively successful societies that developed by extricating themselves from the international market,” although finally they ran into trouble and had to return to the fold.6 But “relatively successful”—and as compared with countries they were like before their revolutions, very successful.

So the fact that Russia had pulled itself out of the West’s traditional Third World service-area and was developing on an independent course was really one of the major motivations behind the Cold War. I mean, the standard line you always hear about it is that we were opposing Stalin’s terror—but that’s total bullshit. First of all, we shouldn’t even be able to repeat that line without a sense of self-mockery, given our record. Do we oppose anybody else’s terror? Do we oppose Indonesia’s terror in East Timor? Do we oppose terror in Guatemala and El Salvador? Do we oppose what we did to South Vietnam? No, we support terror all the time—in fact, we put it in power.

As for Stalin, leaders in the West admired him, they didn’t give a damn about his terror. President Truman, for example, described Stalin as “smart as hell,” “honest,” “we can get along with him,” “it’ll be a real catastrophe if he dies.” He said, what goes on in Russia I don’t really care about, it’s not my business, so long as “we get our way 85 percent of the time.”16 We get our way 85 percent of the time with this nice, smart, decent, honest guy, we can do business with him fine; he wants to murder 40 million people, what do we care? Winston Churchill was the same: the British documents are now being declassified, and after the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Churchill was praising Stalin in internal cabinet meetings as a man of honor we can trust, who can help lead us forward to a new world, a “champion of peace,” “illustrious,” and so on.17 He was particularly impressed with the fact that Stalin didn’t lift a finger while British troops occupied Greece [beginning in November 1944] and under Churchill’s order treated Athens like “a conquered city where a local rebellion is in progress,” carrying out a big massacre to destroy the Greek anti-Nazi resistance and restore the Nazi collaborators to power. Stalin just stood there quietly and let the British do it, so Churchill said he’s a really nice guy.

Okay, then in what sense did socialism fail? I mean, it’s true that the Soviet Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe called themselves “socialist”—but they also called themselves “democratic.” Were they socialist? Well, you can argue about what socialism is, but there are some ideas that are sort of at the core of it, like workers’ control over production, elimination of wage labor, things like that. Did those countries have any of those things? They weren’t even a thought there. Again, in the pre-Bolshevik part of the Russian Revolution, there were socialist initiatives—but they were crushed instantly after the Bolsheviks took power, like within months. In fact, just as the moves towards democracy in Russia were instantly destroyed, the moves towards socialism were equally instantly destroyed. The Bolshevik takeover was a coup—and that was perfectly well understood at the time, in fact. So if you look in the mainstream of the Marxist movement, Lenin’s takeover was regarded as counter-revolutionary; if you look at independent leftists like Bertrand Russell, it was instantly obvious to them; to the libertarian left, it was a truism.21 But that truism has been driven out of people’s heads over the years, as part of a whole prolonged effort to discredit the very idea of socialism by associating it with Soviet totalitarianism. And obviously that effort has been extremely successful—that’s why people can tell themselves that socialism failed when they look at what happened to the Soviet Union, and not even see the slightest thing odd about it. And that’s been a very valuable propaganda triumph for elites in the West—because it’s made it very easy to undercut moves towards real changes in the social system here by saying, “Well, that’s socialism—and look what it leads to.” Okay, hopefully with the fall of the Soviet Union we can at least begin to get past that barrier, and start recovering an understanding of what socialism could really stand for.

And if you just look at how the U.S. media presented the reasons for the invasion at the time, it becomes even more obvious why people in the United States generally supported it. What were supposed to be the reasons for invading Panama and getting rid of Noriega? MAN: Drug trafficking. Drug trafficking? Noriega was much more of a drug trafficker in 1985 than in 1989—why didn’t we have to go and invade Panama and get rid of him in 1985? I mean, if we actually had newspapers in the United States, which we don’t, the first thing they would have asked is, “Why did we have to get rid of Noriega in 1989, but not in 1985?” Well, take a look: what was the difference between 1989 and 1985? MAN: He was on the C.I.A. payroll in ’85. Yeah, he was on the payroll—he was our thug in 1985, so therefore we didn’t have to get rid of him. But in the intervening years he was getting too independent, too big for his britches: he wasn’t following orders, he was supporting the Contadora treaty [a plan for peace in Central America], and other bad stuff like that.42 Well, the United States doesn’t want anything like that in its domains, so at that point we had to get rid of him.

But nevertheless, despite all this, within a couple months of the election the Aristide regime was in fact proving itself to be very successful—which of course made it even more dangerous from the perspective of U.S. power. It was getting support from international lending institutions, because it was cutting down on bureaucracy; it was finally starting to put the country in order after decades of corruption and abuses by the U.S.-backed Duvalier family dictatorship; drug trafficking was being cut back; atrocities were reduced far below the normal level; the flow of refugees to the U.S. virtually stopped.52 Okay, September, there’s a military coup, and Aristide is overthrown. Theoretically the United States announced an embargo and sanctions on the new junta—but that was pure fraud: the Bush administration made it very clear, instantly, that it was not going to pay any attention to the sanctions (meaning nobody else in the world had to pay any attention to them either). Bush established what they called an “exemption” to the embargo—in other words, about eight hundred U.S.-owned firms were made “exempt” from it. The New York Times really had to do a little work on that one. They described this as “fine-tuning” the embargo—you know, to direct it more exactly against the coup leaders, since we don’t want the Haitian people to suffer, as we’ve demonstrated so clearly over the years.

MAN: Noam, since you mentioned the U.S. opposing popular democracy and supporting fascist-type structures in Spain and Haiti—I just want to point out that that also happened in Italy, France, Greece, and other allied Western countries after World War II. I mean, there’s a big history of the U.S. undermining democracy and supporting fascist elements in the past half century or so, even in the rich European societies. That’s right—in fact, that was the first major post-war operation by the United States: to destroy the anti-fascist resistance all over the world and restore more or less fascist structures to power, and also many Fascist collaborators. That happened everywhere, actually: from European countries like Italy and France and Greece, to places like Korea and Thailand.

But Italy was quite different: the Italian resistance was so significant that it basically liberated Northern Italy, and it was holding down maybe six or seven German divisions, and the Italian working-class part of it was very organized, and had widespread support in the population. In fact, when the American and British armies made it up to Northern Italy, they had to throw out a government that had already been established by the Italian resistance in the region, and they had to dismantle various steps towards workers’ control over industry that were being set up. And what they did was to restore the old industrial owners, on the grounds that removal of these Fascist collaborators had been “arbitrary dismissal” of legitimate owners—that’s the term that was used.71 And then we also undermined the democratic processes, because it was obvious that the resistance and not the discredited conservative order was going to win the upcoming elections. So there was a threat of real democracy breaking out in Italy—what’s technically referred to by the U.S. government as “Communism”—and as usual, that had to be stopped.

Actually, the U.S. also reconstructed the Mafia as part of this whole effort to split the European labor movement after the war. I mean, the Mafia had mostly been wiped out by the Fascists—Fascists tend to run a pretty tight ship, they don’t like competition. So Hitler and Mussolini had essentially wiped out the Mafia, and as the American liberating armies moved into Sicily and then through Southern Italy and into France, they reconstituted it as a tool to break strikes. See, the U.S. needed goons to break strikers’ knees on the waterfront and that kind of thing, and where are you going to find guys like that? Well, the answer was, in the Mafia. So in France, the C.I.A.—working together with the leadership of the American labor movement, incidentally—resurrected the Corsican Mafia.

And there were also covert activities in this period involving the Vatican, the U.S. State Department, and British and American intelligence to save and employ many of the worst Nazi war criminals, and use them in exactly the same sorts of operations the Nazis used them for, against the popular resistance forces in the West and then in Eastern Europe. For example, the guy who invented the gas chambers, Walter Rauff, was secreted off to work on counterinsurgency in Chile. The head of Nazi intelligence on the Eastern Front, Reinhard Gehlen, joined American intelligence doing the same kind of work for us in Eastern Europe. The “Butcher of Lyon,” Klaus Barbie, worked for the Americans spying on the French until finally they had to move him out through the Vatican-run “ratline” to Latin America, where then he finished out his career.80 That was another part of the whole post-war effort of the United States to destroy the prospects for independent democracy—and certainly it’s something which took place.

Meanwhile, the real victim of the bombing and the U.S.-imposed embargo has been the general population of Iraq. In fact, literally hundreds of thousands of children have died in Iraq since the end of the war, just as a result of American insistence on maintaining sanctions—and by now the United States and England are alone at the U.N. Security Council in insisting that the sanctions against Iraq still remain in effect, even though the formal U.N. conditions for them have by this point been satisfied.97 But again, that’s another story you won’t see pursued very far in the U.S. press.

WOMAN: So you think in the end the U.S. just wanted to regain control of the Kuwaiti oil fields that Saddam had captured—it was just a war fought for oil? Well, a good place to start if you want to know what something was about is to look to see what changes it introduced. And particularly in the case of a war planned in advance where the outcome was never in any doubt, I think you have solid reason to believe the result was what the thing was really for in the first place. Well, what changes did the Gulf War introduce? The one big thing that happened right as soon as the war ended was that the U.S. arranged the Madrid Conference on the Middle East [in October 1991], which set off what was called the “peace process” that culminated in Israel and the P.L.O. signing the Oslo Agreement in 1994—and with that, the U.S. and Israel won their twenty-year campaign of rejecting the possibility of Palestinian national rights, flat out.102 The Palestinians were basically destroyed.

After the war, the U.S. set up the Madrid Conference and the U.N. didn’t hold any more votes on the Palestinian question after that. The Madrid Conference was run completely by the U.S.—it was based totally on American programs, there was nothing for the Palestinians at all. The agenda was, Israel takes what it wants from the Occupied Territories; the relationships between Israel and the U.S.-client oil monarchies in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Oman and Qatar and so on (which have always existed, even though they were officially at war), now kind of rise above the surface and become more overt—and the Palestinians get it in the neck, they’re offered nothing. And that was the big effect of the Gulf War: it sort of intimidated everyone, it was a big show of American power that demonstrated that the U.S. will use force to get its way wherever it feels like it, now that the Soviet Union is out of the game.

And that’s primarily what the Gulf War was about, I think. It wasn’t about fear of losing oil. It wasn’t about international law, or principled opposition to aggression or anything like that. It wasn’t that they didn’t like Saddam Hussein—they didn’t care about Saddam Hussein one way or the other. It was that after the Gulf War was over, the U.S. was in a perfect position to ram through its rejectionist program and fully extend the Monroe Doctrine to the Middle East [the Monroe Doctrine was proclaimed by the U.S. in 1823 and stated that Latin America was the exclusive domain of the United States, not the European colonial powers]. It was our way of saying: “Look, this is our turf, we’ll do what we feel like here.” As George Bush in fact put it: “What we say goes.”105 Now the world understands that; the Gulf War helped them understand it.

For instance, the U.S. gave very little aid to India. In fact, sometimes it was absolutely scandalous—like, right after Indian independence, in around 1950, India had its last massive famine (under the British there were famines all the time), and while there aren’t very good statistics, probably something on the order of maybe 13 to 15 million people died from starvation. Well, we have the U.S. internal records from that period, and at first there wasn’t even any question of giving them aid—I mean, we had food coming out our ears, just huge food surpluses, but there was no aid going to India because we did not like Nehru’s independence and his moves towards non-alignment and neutrality. But then there was a discussion about whether the U.S. should give India food aid as a weapon—that is, we give them some food aid as a way of forcing them to accept U.S. policies on various issues. And after that, a little bit of aid was trickled out—but it was delayed and conditioned on India’s accepting American positions on things like the Korean War and so on. Nobody knows exactly how many millions of people died because of that.109

I mean, it’s not ancient history, but on the issue of the right of self-determination for the Palestinians, the Europeans have just forgotten what they stood for, at least on paper, until around the time of the Gulf War—because anything like self-determination is completely out of the Oslo Agreement.113

In fact, I think what’s been taking place in the Middle East is really just a part of something much broader that’s happened throughout the West in recent years, particularly since the Gulf War: there’s been a real revival of traditional European racism and imperialism, in a very dramatic way. I mean, people often talk about neo-fascists being on the rise, but I think that’s really missing the point: they’re just the froth on the surface. In my view, what we’re seeing now is a profound revival of pure old-fashioned racist imperialism, with regard to the entire Third World. You see it in articles by British journalists in the New York Times Magazine about how the best thing we can do for Africa is to recolonize it; it shows up at the economic level in structural adjustment programs, which are a big part of how we siphon off the wealth of the Third World to the rich countries; the anti-immigrant campaigns in the U.S. and Europe are a part of it; this program for the Palestinians is another part of it—and one could go on and on.115 The idea is, “We smashed up the world and stole everything from it—now we’re not going to let anyone come and take any piece of it back.” That’s an attitude I see right on the surface all over the place in the West these days.

On things like what’s taking place in the international economy, you’re getting into harder territory—because there, crucial interests of authoritarian institutions are at stake. And at that point, you’re going to have to face the fact, which sooner or later we’re going to have to face after all, that maybe the most totalitarian institution in human history—or certainly close to it—is a corporation: it’s a centrally-managed institution in which authority is structured strictly from top to bottom, control is in the hands of owners and investors, if you’re inside the organization you take orders from above and transmit them down, if you’re outside it there are only extremely weak popular controls, which indeed are fast eroding. And this isn’t some new insight of mine, incidentally—for example, it was pointed out by Thomas Jefferson in his later years, which were only the early days of corporations. Jefferson warned that if power was going to shift into the hands of what he called “banking institutions and moneyed incorporations,” then the democratic experiment would be over: we’d have a form of absolutism worse than what the colonists had struggled against.

I mean, I don’t want to say that it’s a hundred percent immunity—but the fact of the matter is that these two things mean that you can buy a lot of freedom. Look, there isn’t any true capitalist society in the world, it couldn’t survive for ten minutes, but there are variations on capitalism, and the U.S. is towards the capitalist end of the world spectrum—not very far towards it, I should say, but towards it at least in values. And if you had a truly capitalist society, everything would be a commodity, including freedom: there would be as much of it as you can buy. Well, since the U.S. is towards that end of the spectrum, it means there’s an awful lot of freedom around if you can afford it. So if you’re a black organizer in the ghetto, you don’t have much of it, and you’re in trouble—they can send the Chicago police in to murder you, like they did with Fred Hampton [a Black Panther assassinated by the F.B.I. in 1969]. But if you’re a white professional like me, you can buy a lot of freedom.

Well, why was Japan so competitive with the U.S. economically, despite highly inauspicious conditions? There are a lot of reasons. But the main reason is that they directed their public subsidy straight to the commercial market. So to work on lasers, they tried to figure out ways of producing lasers for the commercial market, and they do it pretty well. But when we want to develop lasers for the commercial market, what we do is pour the money into the Pentagon, which then tries to work out a way to use a laser to shoot down a missile ten thousand miles away—and if they can work that out, then they hope there’ll be some commercial spin-offs that come out of it all. Okay, that’s less efficient. And since the Japanese are no dumber than we are, and they have an efficient system of state-coordination while we have an inefficient one, over the years they succeeded in the economic competition.

But even after the rising bourgeoisie in England had driven millions of peasants off the land, there was a period when the population’s “right to live” still was preserved by what we would today call “welfare.” There was a set of laws in England which gave people rights, called the “Poor Laws” [initially and most comprehensively codified in 1601]—which essentially kept you alive if you couldn’t survive otherwise; they provided sort of a minimum level of subsistence, like subsidies on food and so on. And there was also something called the “Corn Laws” [dating in varying forms from the twelfth century], which gave landlords certain rights beyond those they could get on the market—they raised the price of corn, that sort of thing. And together, these laws were considered among the main impediments to the new rising British industrial class—so therefore they just had to go. Well, those people needed an ideology to support their effort to knock out of people’s heads the idea that they had this basic right to live, and that’s what classical economics was about—classical economics said: no one has any right to live, you only have a right to what you can gain for yourself on the labor market. And the founders of classical economics in fact said they’d developed a “scientific theory” of it, with—as they put it—“the certainty of the principle of gravitation.”

Look: the basic assumption of the classical economists was that labor is highly mobile and capital is relatively immobile—that’s required, that’s crucial to proving all their nice theorems. That was the reason they could say, “If you can’t get enough to survive on the labor market, go someplace else”—because you could go someplace else: after the native populations of places like the United States and Australia and Tasmania were exterminated or driven away, then yeah, poor Europeans could go someplace else. So in the early nineteenth century, labor was indeed mobile. And back then, capital was indeed immobile—first because “capital” primarily meant land, and you can’t move land, and also because to the extent that there was investment, it was very local: like, you didn’t have communications systems that allowed for easy transfers of money all around the world, like we do today.

And they use one factory as an example, a stove factory that’s being set up in Tulsa by the Whirlpool corporation. Well, the last paragraph of the article points out how the “free market” really works: the reason why Whirlpool decided to put the factory in Tulsa instead of, say, in Mexico, is that the taxpayers in Tulsa County are going to pay 25 percent of the corporation’s capital costs.37 Okay, that’s how the free market really works—in fact, that’s how it’s always worked, from the early days of the industrial revolution right up until this morning, without any known exception.

Or take the fact that so many people live in the suburbs and everybody has to drive their own car everywhere. Was that a result of the “free market”? No, it was because the U.S. government carried out a massive social-engineering project in the 1950s to destroy the public transportation system in favor of expanding a highly inefficient system based on cars and airplanes—because that’s what benefits big industry. It started with corporate conspiracies to buy up and eliminate streetcar systems, and then continued with huge public subsidies to build the highway system and encourage an extremely inefficient and environmentally destructive alternative. That’s what led to the suburbanization of the country—so you get huge shopping malls in the suburbs, and devastation in the inner cities.44 But these policies were a result of planning—they had nothing to do with the “free market.”

Actually, the most dramatic example of these “market distortions” that I can think of—which I suspect is never even taught in economics courses—concerns the reason why the United States had an industrial revolution in the first place. Remember, the industrial revolution was fueled by textiles, meaning one commodity: cotton. And cotton was cheap, that was crucially important. Well, why was cotton cheap? Was it because of market forces? No. Cotton was cheap because they exterminated the native population here and brought in slaves—that’s why cotton was cheap.

Today it’s oil that’s at the center of the industrial economies. And why is oil cheap? Well, that’s what you pay your taxes for: a large part of the Pentagon system exists to make sure that oil prices stay within a certain range—not too low, because Western economies and energy corporations depend on the profits from it, but not too high, because that might interfere with what’s called the “efficiency” of international trade [i.e. because transport and other costs of trade rise with the oil price]. Well, trade is only “efficient” because a lot of force and international violence keeps oil prices from going too high, so if you really wanted to measure the “efficiency of trade,” you’d have to figure in all of the other costs which make it that way, like the costs of the Pentagon for one. And if anyone ever did that, you couldn’t possibly say that trade is “efficient.”

Also, if you just look at the composition of the prison population, you’ll find that the crime-control policy that’s been developed is very finely honed to target select populations. So for example, what’s called the “War on Drugs,” which has very little to do with stopping the flow of drugs, has a lot to do with controlling the inner-city populations, and poor people in general. In fact, by now over half the prisoners in federal prisons are there on drug charges—and it’s largely for possession offenses, meaning victimless crimes, about a third just for marijuana.34 Moreover, the “Drug War” specifically has been targeted on the black and Hispanic populations—that’s one of its most striking features. So for instance, the drug of choice in the ghetto happens to be crack cocaine, and you get huge mandatory sentences for it; the drug of choice in the white suburbs, like where I live, happens to be powder cocaine, and you don’t get anywhere near the same penalties for it.

In fact, the perception of more violence is rather like what’s happened in the case of welfare: people’s image is that welfare has gone way up, but the reality is, it’s gone way, way down.49 So I don’t know if you’ve looked at the polls on this, but people’s attitudes are really quite striking. For example, when you ask them, “Do you think we’re spending too much on welfare or too little?,” 44 percent say we’re spending too much, and 23 percent say we’re spending too little. But if you take exactly the same question and you just replace the word “welfare” with “assistance to the poor”—so now you’re saying, “Are we giving too much or too little assistance to the poor?”—the numbers change radically: 13 percent say it’s too much, and 64 percent say it’s too little.50 Alright, that’s kind of funny: what’s welfare? It’s assistance to the poor. So how come you get this strange result? Because people have bought the racist line.

Now, about speculative capital—that’s an extremely important part of this. You’re absolutely correct that it’s having a huge impact on national governments. This is really a major phenomenon. Just the numbers themselves are dramatic. Back around 1970, about 90 percent of the capital involved in international economic transactions was being used for more or less productive commercial purposes, like production and trade, and about 10 percent was being used for speculation. Today those figures are reversed: by 1990, about 90 percent was being used for speculation, and by 1994 it was up to 95 percent. Furthermore, the absolute amount of speculative capital has just exploded: the last estimate I saw from the World Bank was that there is now about $14 trillion involved—which means there’s now $14 trillion free to transfer from one national economy to another, an amount which just overwhelms any national government’s resources, and leaves governments with only an extremely narrow range of choices when it comes to setting policies.

The hedge fund run by another of the Kochs’ major investors, Robert Mercer, an eccentric computer scientist who made a fortune using sophisticated mathematical algorithms to trade stocks, also seemed a possible government target. Democrats in Congress were considering imposing a tax on stock trading, which the firm he co-chaired, Renaissance Technologies, did in massive quantities at computer-driven high frequency. Although those familiar with his thinking maintained that his political activism was separate from his pecuniary interests, Mercer had additional business reasons to be antigovernment. The IRS was investigating whether his firm improperly avoided paying billions of dollars in taxes, a charge the firm denied. Employment laws, too, would prove an embarrassing headache to him; three domestic servants soon sued him for refusing to pay overtime and maintained that he had docked their wages unfairly for infractions such as failing to replace shampoo bottles from his bathrooms when they were less than one-third full. The tabloid news stories about the case invariably mentioned that Mercer had previously brought a suit of his own, suing a toy-train manufacturer for overbilling him by $2 million for an elaborate electric train set he had installed in his Long Island, New York, mansion. With a pay package of $125 million in 2011, Mercer was ranked by Forbes as the sixteenth-highest-paid hedge fund manager that year.

Private foundations have very few legal restrictions. They are required to donate at least 5 percent of their assets every year to public charities—referred to as "nonprofit" organizations. In exchange, the donors are granted deductions, enabling them to reduce their income taxes dramatically. This arrangement enables the wealthy to simultaneously receive generous tax subsidies and use their foundations to impact society as they please. In addition, the process often confers an aura of generosity and public-spiritedness on the donors, acting as a salve against class resentment.

Once elected, Reagan embraced the Heritage Foundation’s phone-book-sized policy playbook, Mandate for Leadership, and distributed a copy of it to every member of Congress. His administration soon delivered an impressive number of items on its wish list. Heritage had laid out 1,270 specific policy proposals. According to Feulner, the Reagan administration adopted 61 percent of them.

If the Olin Foundation was less than transparent about its mission, it was not for the first time. Between 1958 and 1966, it secretly served as a bank for the Central Intelligence Agency. During these eight years, the CIA laundered $1.95 million through the foundation. Olin, according to Miller, regarded his undercover role as just part of his patriotic duty. Many of the government funds went to anti-Communist intellectuals and publications. But in 1967, the press exposed the covert propaganda operation, triggering a political furor and causing the CIA to fold the program. The CIA money at the Olin Foundation, which was not publicized at the time, disappeared as quietly as it had arrived. The idea of using the private foundation to fund ideologically aligned intellectuals, however, persisted.

Without the rigorous peer-reviewed standards required by prestigious academic publications, the Olin Foundation was able to inject into the mainstream a number of works whose scholarship was debatable at best. For example, Olin Foundation funds enabled John R. Lott Jr., then an Olin fellow at the University of Chicago, to write his influential book More Guns, Less Crime. In the work, Lott argued that more guns actually reduce crime and that the legalization of concealed weapons would make citizens safer. Politicians advocating weaker gun control laws frequently cited Lott’s findings. But according to Adam Winkler, the author of Gunfight, Lott’s scholarship was suspect. Winkler wrote that "Lott’s claimed source for this information was ‘national surveys,’ " which under questioning he revised to just one survey that he and research assistants had conducted. When asked to provide the data, Winkler recounts, Lott said he had lost it in a computer crash. Asked for any evidence of the survey, writes Winkler, "Lott said he had no such evidence." (Proving that the recipients of Olin funds weren’t ideologically monolithic, Winkler, too, had received funds from the foundation.)

Piereson, however, admitted that the beauty of the program was that it was a stealth political attack and that the country’s best law schools didn’t grasp this and therefore didn’t block the ideological punch it packed. "I saw it as a way into the law schools—I probably shouldn’t confess that," he told The New York Times in 2005. "Economic analysis tends to have conservatizing effects." In a later interview with the political scientist Steven M. Teles, he added that he would have preferred to fund a conservative constitutional law program, but had the foundation tried such a direct political challenge, it probably would have been barred entry to America’s best law schools. "If you said to a dean that you wanted to fund conservative constitutional law, he would reject the idea out of hand. But if you said you wanted to support Law and Economics, he would be much more open to the idea," he confided. "Law and Economics is neutral, but it has a philosophical thrust in the direction of free markets and limited government. That is, like many disciplines, it seems neutral, but it isn’t in fact."

More controversial still were Law and Economics seminars that the Olin Foundation funded for judges. The seminars were initiated by Henry Manne, who had become dean of the George Mason University School of Law in Virginia, which he was trying to transform into a hub of libertarian jurisprudence. The seminars treated judges to two-week-long, all-expenses-paid immersion training in Law and Economics usually in luxurious settings like the Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Florida. They soon became popular free vacations for the judges, a cross between Maoist cultural reeducation camps and Club Med. After a few hours of learning why environmental and labor laws were anathema, or why, as Manne argued, insider-trading laws did more harm than good, the judges broke for golf, swimming, and delightful dinners with their hosts. Within a few years, 660 judges had gone on these junkets, some, like the U.S. Court of Appeals judge and unconfirmed Supreme Court nominee Douglas Ginsburg, many times. By one count, 40 percent of the federal judiciary participated, including the future Supreme Court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas. A variety of major corporations eagerly joined Olin and other conservative foundations in footing the bills. A study by the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity found that between 2008 and 2012 close to 185 federal judges attended judicial seminars sponsored by conservative interests, several of which had cases before the courts. The lead underwriters were the Charles Koch Foundation, the Searle Freedom Trust, ExxonMobil, Shell Oil, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and State Farm, the insurance company. Topics ranged from "The Moral Foundations of Capitalism" to "Terrorism, Climate, and Central Planning: Challenges to Liberty and the Rule of Law."

Losing Ground, which was written in a tone of sorrow rather than anger, blamed government programs for creating a culture of dependence among the poor. Critics said it overlooked macroeconomic issues over which the poor had no control, and academics and journalists were split, with several challenging Murray’s scholarship. Nonetheless, with ample funding from Olin and other conservative foundations, Murray succeeded in shifting the debate over America’s poor from society’s shortcomings to their own. Despite Reagan’s professed antipathy toward big government, his administration steered cautiously away from Murray’s controversial libertarianism, preferring to criticize welfare cheaters rather than the whole idea of government-run antipoverty programs. But to the dismay of liberals, Bill Clinton, a "New Democrat," later embraced his ideas, calling Murray’s analysis "essentially right" and incorporating many of his prescriptions, including work requirements and the end to aid as an entitlement, in his 1996 welfare reform bill. "It took ten years," Murray has said, "for Losing Ground to go from being controversial to conventional wisdom."

When it bought the Allen-Bradley company, two-thirds of Rockwell’s revenues, and half of its profits, came from U.S. government contracts. Rockwell had become, in fact, a poster child for wasteful government spending. The Los Angeles Times called it a "symbol of a military industrial complex gone berserk." Rockwell’s coffers were bulging with cash, but its reputation had taken a hit from its role as the main contractor producing the B-1 bomber, an aircraft so maligned it earned the nickname the Flying Edsel. President Carter had canceled the program as a waste of money, but after Rockwell waged a strenuous lobbying campaign, President Reagan had brought it back to life. As part of his administration’s huge defense buildup, Reagan also authorized the manufacture of the MX missile system, another multibillion-dollar defense program that was widely criticized as unnecessary, for which Rockwell was the largest contractor. Thus, by 1984, thanks to profligate government spending, Rockwell had one of the strongest balance sheets in the business, with $1.3 billion in cash piling up on its ledgers.

Barnes-Soliz later told Bloomberg Markets magazine, "The refinery was just hemorrhaging benzene into the atmosphere." Rather than comply with a new 1995 federal regulation requiring reductions in such emissions, Koch Industries had tried to conceal its output in a report that it was required to file with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Internally, a Koch lawyer conceded that the company’s self-reporting was "misleading and inaccurate," so the company had then called in Barnes-Soliz to provide a more accurate account. She had been working with Koch Industries for five years and loved the job because she felt she was contributing directly to the health and safety of employees and the public. As directed, she carefully re-tabulated the refinery’s benzene emissions and found the company had released fifteen times more than the legal limit. Her bosses were unhappy with her findings. She had a bachelor’s degree in science and environmental health and a master’s of science in industrial hygiene, so she knew what she was doing, but nonetheless she redid the math many times. But she kept getting the same unwelcome results. "There were a lot of meetings to try and get me to change the number. It was hard, but I held firm to my convictions," she recounted to Bloomberg Markets. She was thus shaken when she saw the subsequent report submitted by Koch to the Texas authorities. It falsified the benzene emissions to 1/149th of the amount she had calculated.

But Koch Industries in Corpus Christi was hit with a ninety-seven-count indictment on September 28, 2000, charging it with covering up the discharge of ninety-one metric tons of benzene. The company faced the potential of $352 million in fines, and four Koch employees faced potentially long prison sentences and fines of $1.75 million each. The company fought back hard in the courts, trying to withhold hundreds of internal e-mails about its emissions, but the presiding judge rejected its argument that these were trade secrets, castigating its lawyer as a "front man" who was trying to "impede" regulators from discovering the "extent of its noncompliance." During the course of the wrangling, the company revealed that it would have cost $7 million to comply with the emission standards. High though the cost might seem, it was dwarfed by the refinery’s profits. Prosecutors testified that the Kochs’ Corpus Christi refinery earned $176 million in profits during 1995 alone. Eventually, Koch Industries pleaded guilty to one felony charge of "concealment of information" about its benzene emissions and paid $10 million in fines, and made another $10 million payment for projects to improve the environment in Corpus Christi.

After weighing the committee’s charges against Koch Industries for eighteen months, the Oklahoma City grand jury cleared the company in a decision that was clouded by the kind of intrigue that would characterize the Kochs’ later political involvement. The Nation obtained internal company records showing that in the face of potential criminal charges the Kochs had launched an emergency strategy aimed at buying political leverage. In Oklahoma, where the grand jury was meeting, they made donations to key politicians, including Senator Nickles. Around the same time, Nickles recommended the appointment of a new U.S. attorney in Oklahoma City to oversee the grand jury investigation. In making his recommendation, Senator Nickles passed over the head of the criminal division in the office and chose a protégé, Timothy Leonard, a former Republican state senator with no experience in criminal law whose family had financial interests in oil wells receiving Koch royalties. There were calls for his recusal, but President George H. W. Bush’s Justice Department granted his request for a waiver. Nancy Jones, the assistant U.S. attorney in the office who was handling the Oklahoma grand jury investigation of Koch Industries, parsed her words carefully when asked later if political pressure had ended the probe. "You can say this," she said, after a notably long pause. "The man who was passed over to be U.S. attorney was a liberal Democrat from out of state, and the one they appointed was a Republican with no federal, criminal, or trial experience." Elroy, the former FBI agent, was less circumspect. In his opinion, "Nickles put the kibosh on the prosecution there. He got involved in the appointment of the U.S. attorney. He was getting a tremendous amount of support from Koch. He was their man. He was the best senator money could buy." Nickles summarily dismissed allegations of political interference, saying he was "not even aware that the U.S. Attorney’s office was involved in a criminal investigation of Koch." He added that he had "never had a conversation" with Leonard, the U.S. attorney, "about it." Leonard also denied any impropriety. But Arizona’s Democratic senator, Dennis DeConcini, a former prosecutor who had chaired the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, said at the time, "I was surprised and disappointed. Our evidence was so strong. Our investigation was some of the finest work the Senate has ever done. There was an overwhelming case against Koch."

Their investment quickly transformed the brothers’ political status. By 1996, they had grown into major players in the Republican Party. David Koch went from dismissing Bob Dole, the senator from Kansas, the home of Koch Industries, as just another "Establishment" politician "with no moral principles," in the early 1980s, to becoming the vice-chair of Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign against Bill Clinton. No longer an outsider, the Koch family became Dole’s third-largest financial backer. David Koch in fact hosted a birthday party for Dole, at which the candidate raised $150,000.

Few outside the rarefied world of far-right, laissez-faire economics noticed, but the Kochs’ multidimensional political spending kept growing. Between 1998 and 2008, for instance, Charles Koch’s private fund, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, made more than $48 million in tax-deductible grants, primarily to groups promoting his political views. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, which was controlled by Charles and his wife, Liz, along with two company employees and an accountant, similarly made more than $28 million in tax-deductible grants. David Koch’s fund, the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation, made more than $120 million in tax-deductible grants—many to cultural and scientific projects rather than political. Meanwhile, during those years Koch Industries spent more than $50 million on lobbying. Separately, the company’s political action committee, KochPAC, donated some $8 million to political campaigns, more than 80 percent of it to Republicans. In addition, the Kochs and other family members spent millions more on personal campaign contributions.

With Cato and the Institute for Humane Studies, the Kochs checked off the first item on Fink’s shopping list for social change—institutions that could hatch scholarly ideas in line with their own thinking. The Mercatus Center checked off the second item, a more practical organization aimed at promoting these ideas into action. Its location, just across the Potomac from the Capitol, was a bonus, enabling its fellows to testify regularly as independent experts at congressional hearings. By 2004, The Wall Street Journal dubbed it "the most important think tank you’ve never heard of" and noted that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a "hit list" had been suggested by Mercatus scholars. Eight of those were environmental protections. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have "other means of fighting [their] battles" and that the Mercatus Center does not actively promote the company’s private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of Texas who specialized in environmental issues, argued that "Koch has been constantly in trouble with the EPA, and Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."

The most fateful Mercatus Center hire might have been Wendy Gramm, an economist and director at the giant Texas energy company Enron who was the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, the powerful Texas Republican. In the mid-1990s, she became the head of Mercatus’s Regulatory Studies Program. There, she pushed Congress to support what came to be known as the Enron Loophole, exempting the type of energy derivatives from which Enron profited from regulatory oversight. Both Enron and Koch Industries, which also was a major trader of derivatives, lobbied desperately for the loophole. Koch claimed there was no need for government policing because corporations’ concern for their reputations would cause them to self-regulate.

Political contributions from oil, gas, and coal companies became increasingly polarized during this period. In 1990, the oil and gas industry’s political giving was skewed 60 percent in favor of Republicans and 40 percent in favor of Democrats. By the middle of the Bush years, 80 percent of the industry’s giving went to Republicans. Giving from coal-mining firms was even more lopsided, with 90 percent going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The investment soon paid off. As the Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol writes in a study of climate change denial, the Republican Party, particularly in the U.S. Congress, soon swung sharply to the right on climate issues. Partisan differences remained small among the general public but grew into a gaping chasm among elected officials. Conservative opponents of carbon regulations, like James Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma who received serial campaign donations from Koch Industries PAC, turned the rhetoric up to a boiling point. Global warming, he proclaimed, was "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people." Inhofe’s spokesman, Marc Morano, had a reputation as a professional "pit bull," as Mann later put it, derived from his earlier role promoting the claims of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group that had smeared John Kerry’s military record during his 2004 presidential campaign. At the time, Morano was working for a conservative news outlet that was funded in part by the Scaife, Bradley, and Olin Foundations.

Gillespie called the plan "REDMAP," an acronym for the Redistricting Majority Project. To implement it, he took over the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), a nonprofit group that had previously functioned as a catchall bank account for corporations interested in influencing state laws. All he needed was enough money to put REDMAP into action. By the end of 2010, with the help of million-dollar donations from the tobacco companies Altria and Reynolds, as well as huge donations from Walmart, the pharmaceutical industry, and rich private donors like those at the Koch summit, the RSLC would have $30 million, three times its Democratic counterpart. "It was three yards and a cloud of dust," Gillespie later recalled of his scramble for money. "It was a constant working, and working, and working," especially at honeypots like the Koch summit.

Ellis had a history of creating fake movements in support of unpopular corporations and causes. In the 1990s, he had headed a company called Ramhurst, which documents revealed to be a covert public relations arm of R. J. Reynolds, the giant tobacco company. Under his guidance, Ramhurst organized deceptively homegrown-looking "smokers’ rights" protests against proposed regulations and taxes on tobacco. In 1994 alone, R. J. Reynolds funneled $2.6 million to Ramhurst to deploy operatives who mobilized what they called "partisans" to stage protests against the Clinton health-care proposal, which would have imposed a stiff tax on cigarette sales. Anti-health-care rallies that year echoed with cries of "Go back to Russia!"

The Kochs were part of a national explosion of dark money. In 2006, only 2 percent of "outside" political spending came from "social welfare" groups that hid their donors. In 2010, this number rose to 40 percent, masking hundreds of millions of dollars. Campaign-finance reformers were apoplectic but powerless. "The political players who are soliciting these funds and are benefiting from the expenditure of these funds will know where the money came from," argued Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the liberal Campaign Legal Center. "The only ones in the dark will be American voters."

By July, Democratic strategists began to feel a strange undertow, as if an offshore tsunami were gathering force. One operative put together a chart compiling the pledged midterm expenditures by ten Republican-aligned independent groups and was appalled to discover that this slice of the total spending alone would likely reach at least $200 million. Americans for Prosperity had pledged to spend $45 million. Karl Rove’s group American Crossroads had pledged $52 million. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had committed to spend $75 million. Countless other groups, including an unknown number of dark-money organizations loaded with secret funds, were lined up to spend millions and millions more. A Democratic operative who saw the chart, which was passed around like samizdat within the party, admitted that it was "one hell of a wake-up call."

Bob Phillips, the head of the North Carolina chapter of Common Cause, an organization that promotes stricter controls on political money, watched the unfolding drama closely and concluded that the Citizens United decision was an even bigger "game changer" at the local level than at the national. He said it enabled a single donor, particularly one with access to major corporate funds like Pope or the Kochs, to play a significant and even decisive role. "We didn’t have that before 2010," Phillips says. "Citizens United opened up the door. Now a candidate can literally be outspent by independent groups. We saw it in North Carolina, and a lot of the money was traced back to Art Pope."

THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE 112TH CONGRESS TOOK PLACE ON JANUARY 5, 2011, WHEN Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, handed off an oversized ceremonial gavel to her successor, John Boehner. But a new era of ultraconservative billionaire influence had already begun. Before the public swearing-in ceremony got under way, David Koch, whose donor network had spent at least $130.7 million on winning a Republican majority, was in the new Speaker-to-be’s ornate office, chatting amiably with his staff. "The People’s House" was under new management and, critics would suggest, new ownership.

The 112th Congress soon unfolded as a case study of what David Frum, an adviser to the former president George W. Bush, described as the growing and in his view destructive influence of the Republican Party’s "radical rich." The "radicalization of the party’s donor base," he observed, "propelled the party to advocate policies that were more extreme than anything seen since Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign." It also "led Republicans in Congress to try tactics they would never have dared use before." Hard data supported this. Harvard’s Theda Skocpol found that the House "took the biggest leap to the far right" since political scientists began recording quantitative measurements of legislators’ positions. There was no better example than the Kochs’ newly won influence over the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The story revealed in depth for the first time how the publicity-shy Koch brothers had stealthily leveraged their vast fortune to exert outsized influence over American politics.

It defined itself as a free-market advocacy group and filed papers with the IRS proclaiming that "the grant funds shall not be used for political activity."

Those cuts had lowered the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. With bipartisan support, Bush had also slashed taxes on unearned income, most of which went to the rich. Taxes on dividends, for instance, were reduced dramatically from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. Taxes on capital gains, the overwhelming bulk of which were reaped by the wealthy, fell from 20 percent to 15 percent. As a result, many of the richest Americans were taxed at lower rates than middle- and working-class wage earners.

The tax code hadn’t always been so lopsided. As income grew increasingly concentrated at the top during the twentieth century, the tax code grew more generous to those with extreme wealth in response to the political pressure they put on lawmakers. The first peacetime income tax was enacted in 1894 as the result of William Jennings Bryan’s Populist movement and applied to only the richest eighty-five thousand Americans out of a population of sixty-five million, or the top 0.1 percent. But the Supreme Court struck it down after the robber barons waged a proxy legal battle. Eighteen years later, the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution legalized the income tax, which in the beginning was only levied on the very rich. Rates were especially high in wartimes, when the taxes were seen as part of the patriotic duty of the privileged. During World War I, top earners paid a rate of 77 percent, and during World War II they paid a rate of 94 percent. (It was this tax that the Scaife family had avoided with its elaborate trusts and foundations.) Soon, though, those at the very top succeeded in shifting the burden to those beneath them, so that by 1942 nearly two-thirds of the population paid income taxes. The rates remained relatively progressive for decades, with the top bracket paying a 50 percent rate in 1981. But the 1970s kicked off a three-decade-long "tax-cutting spree" during which the wealthiest 1 percent succeeded in getting their average effective federal tax rate slashed by a third, and the very, very richest, the 0.01 percent of the population, did even better, getting its effective federal tax rate cut in half. Unsurprisingly, the distribution of wealth in America grew increasingly skewed.

The most shocking aspect was its radical rewrite of America’s social contract. To reduce the deficit, Ryan prescribed massive cuts in government spending, 62 percent of which would come from programs for the poor, even though these programs accounted for only about a fifth of the federal budget. According to a New York Times analysis of a similar, later version of Ryan’s budget, 1.8 million people would be cut off food stamps, 280,000 children would lose their school lunch subsidies, and 300,000 children would lose medical coverage. Robert Greenstein of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities called the plan "Robin Hood in reverse," arguing, "It would likely produce the largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in modern U.S. history."

This consolidation of power reflected the overall national trend of increasingly large and concentrated campaign spending by the ultra-wealthy in the post–Citizens United era. The spending, in turn, was a reflection of the growing concentration of wealth more generally in America. As a result, the 2012 election was a tipping point of sorts. Not only was it by far the most expensive election in the country’s history; it was also the first time since the advent of modern campaign-finance laws when outside spending groups, including super PACs and tax-exempt nonprofit groups, flush with unlimited contributions from the country’s richest donors, spent more than $1 billion to influence federal elections. And when the spending on attack ads run by nonprofits was factored in, outside spending groups might well have outspent the campaigns and the political parties for the first time.

The Koch network loomed as a colossus over this new political landscape. On the right, there were other formidable donor networks, including the one assembled by Karl Rove, but no single outside group spent as much. On its own, in 2012 the Kochs’ network of a few hundred individuals spent at least $407 million, almost all of it anonymously. This was more than John McCain spent on his entire 2008 presidential bid. And it was more than the combined contributions to the two presidential campaigns made by 5,667,658 Americans, whose donations were legally capped at $5,000. Politico’s Kenneth Vogel crunched the numbers and discovered that in the presidential race the top 0.04 percent of donors contributed about the same amount as the bottom 68 percent. No previous year for which there were data had shown more spending by fewer people. The staggeringly lopsided situation made 2012 the starkest test yet of Louis Brandeis’s dictum that the country could have either "democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few," but not both.

Gingrich’s attack on capitalist excess was underwritten by one of the richest men in the world whose international gambling empire was at that moment under federal criminal investigation for laundering money and foreign corrupt practices. Eventually, according to court testimony, Adelson’s company paid a $47 million out-of-court settlement in the money-laundering case for failing to report a $45 million transfer of cash it made on behalf of a Chinese-Mexican businessman who was under investigation for drug trafficking. In another case, Adelson’s former chief executive officer accused the mogul’s subsidiary in Macao of consorting with organized crime figures and making excessive payments to a local official that might breach laws prohibiting U.S. citizens from engaging in corrupt practices overseas. Adelson described the allegations as "delusional and fabricated." But the legal cloud did little to enhance the image of the Koch network or the GOP. Instead of shoring up the Republican ticket, big money tainted the brand, prolonged the primaries, pushed the candidates to adopt their donors’ pet issues, and, all in all, did the Democrats’ work for them.

According to a report by ProPublica, Hofeller and his team were hired for the job by a dark-money group called the State Government Leadership Foundation. This was actually an offshoot of the group that Gillespie had used to run REDMAP, the Republican State Leadership Committee. But unlike the main group, the offshoot was a 501(c)(4) "social welfare" organization that could conceal the identities of its donors. Adding one more layer of security to the operation in North Carolina was a state-level dark-money group calling itself Fair and Legal Redistricting for North Carolina. The work, like the funding, was stealthy. Hofeller kept a PowerPoint presentation on his computer with admonitions such as "Make sure your security is real." "Make sure your computer is in a PRIVATE location." He warned, "Emails are the tool of the devil." He also stressed that those working with him should "use personal contact or a safe phone!" "Don’t reveal more than necessary." "BEWARE of nonpartisan, or bipartisan, staff bearing gifts," he added. "They probably are not your friends." In theory, redistricting was supposed to reflect the fundamental democratic principle of one person, one vote. The shifting U.S. population was supposed to be equally distributed in accordance with the new census figures, across all 435 of the country’s congressional districts. In a charade of fairness, Republican legislators overseeing the process in North Carolina crisscrossed the state to hold public hearings, gathering comments and suggestions from citizens about how the lines could best be drawn.

Progressive groups immediately filed suit, alleging that the new maps violated the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory elections. Republican officials defended the maps as fair. Here, too, however, a flood of undisclosed cash spent by dark-money groups affiliated with Pope and other members of the Koch network influenced the course of events. The case was headed to the state’s supreme court where the Republicans held a 4–3 majority, making it likely that the Republican redistricting plan would get a friendly hearing. But before that could happen, the judges were up for reelection in 2012, and conservatives worried that one Republican incumbent appeared likely to lose. His Democratic challenger seemed poised to tip the court’s political balance toward the Democrats, imperiling the Republican redistricting plan. But a sudden wave of outside cash rescued Paul Newby, the Republican judge, just in time. Outside groups spent more than $2.3 million helping him, an unheard-of sum in such a judicial race.

The agenda this money was behind became apparent once the Republicans won control of North Carolina’s general assembly. In a matter of months, they enacted conservative policies that private think tanks had been incubating for years. The legislature slashed taxes on corporations and the wealthy while cutting benefits and services for the middle class and the poor. It also gutted environmental programs, sharply limited women’s access to abortion, backed a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and legalized concealed guns in bars and on playgrounds and school campuses. It also erected cumbersome new bureaucratic barriers to voting. Like the poll taxes and literacy tests of the segregated past, the new hurdles, critics said, were designed to discourage poor and minority voters, who leaned Democratic. The election law expert Richard Hasen declared, "I’ve never seen a package of what I would call suppressive voting measures like this." The historian Dan T. Carter, who specialized in southern history at the University of South Carolina, noted that when friends around the country asked if things in North Carolina were as bad as they looked from the outside, he was forced to answer, "No, it’s worse—a lot worse."

Among the new power brokers, few if any could match the political clout of the Kochs. The reach of their "integrated network" was unique. One reflection of their singular status was their relationship with the new majority leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell. Only a few months before assuming that position, McConnell had been an honored speaker at their June donor summit. There, he had thanked "Charles and David" and added, "I don’t know where we would be without you." Soon after he was sworn in, McConnell hired a new policy chief—a former lobbyist for Koch Industries.

Marc Short, the president of Freedom Partners, acknowledged that "2014 was nice, but there’s a long way to go." To get there, according to one ally, that weekend Charles and David Koch each pledged to give $75 million. If so, their contributions would still represent a mere fraction of the network’s new fund-raising goal announced that weekend. This time, the Koch network aimed to spend $889 million in the 2016 election cycle. The sum was more than twice what the network had spent in 2012. It rivaled the record $1 billion that each of the two major political parties was expected to spend, securing their unique status as a rival center of gravity. The Kochs could afford it. Despite their predictions that Obama would prove catastrophic to the American economy, Charles’s and David’s personal fortunes had nearly tripled during his presidency, from $14 billion apiece in March 2009 to $41.6 billion each in March 2015, according to Forbes.

Są też inne kary, nazywane ekspiacyjnymi, czyli wynagradzającymi. Bardzo zręczna nazwa, żeby nie powiedzieć, że chodzi o zwykłą zemstę społeczności na przestępcy. Kary te są najczęściej stosowane wobec funkcjonariuszy, zwłaszcza tych, którzy popełniają przestępstwa finansowe lub pedofilskie. Przykładem może być sprawa arcybiskupa Wesołowskiego.

Kto może być biskupem? Ano ten może, kto odznacza się „niezachwianą wiarą, dobrymi obyczajami, pobożnością, gorliwością duszy, pasterską mądrością, roztropnością i ludzkimi cnotami, jak również pozostałymi przymiotami, które czynią go odpowiednim do wypełniania zleconego mu urzędu”, a także dobrą opinią; ma przynajmniej trzydzieści pięć lat; przynajmniej pięć lat kapłaństwa; doktorat lub przynajmniej licencjat z Pisma Świętego, teologii lub prawa kanonicznego (…) lub „prawdziwą biegłość w tych dyscyplinach”[12] .

Żaden prawdziwy duszpasterz nie miał szansy zostać biskupem. Wyglądało to standardowo tak: kleryk prymus albo od razu po święceniach, albo po roku szedł na studia specjalistyczne, a po powrocie z doktoratem zostawał wykładowcą w seminarium, później rektorem i wreszcie biskupem pomocniczym. Przy dobrych układach po kilku lub kilkunastu latach dostawał własną diecezję. Efekt takiej ścieżki kariery był (i jest) następujący: większość polskich biskupów jeśli w ogóle przepracowała choć rok na parafii (a jest sporo takich, którzy tak zwanymi zwykłymi księżmi z ich troskami i radościami nigdy nie byli), to było to bardzo dawno temu. Ich wiedza i znajomość realnego życia i duszpasterstwa jest znikoma lub żadna. Ale to właśnie oni stają się elitą korporacji KRK w Polsce.

Co ciekawe, przez wieki KRK bardzo chronił swoich członków przed bezpośrednim kontaktem z Biblią. Tłumaczenia na języki narodowe były surowo zakazane, a kto się na nie odważył, ryzykował życiem (patrz: William Tyndale[64] ).

powstała jakiś czas temu w Polsce pewna katolicka wspólnota – SYCHAR, która ma się zajmować właśnie ratowaniem za wszelką cenę małżeństw zagrożonych rozpadem. Bo tylko ten rozpad widziany jest jako tragedia. Wszystko inne to pikuś… Oto dwa cytaty z ich strony internetowej: „Charyzmatem Wspólnoty Trudnych Małżeństw SYCHAR jest dążenie jej członków do uzdrowienia sakramentalnego małżeństwa, które przeżywa kryzys. Współpracując z Jezusem Chrystusem – Bogiem, w każdej sytuacji, nawet po ludzku patrząc beznadziejnej, możliwe jest odrodzenie małżeństwa (sic!). Dla Boga bowiem nie ma rzeczy niemożliwych. Prawda o mocy sakramentu oznacza, że nawet jeśli małżonkowie nie potrafią ze sobą być i odchodzą w stan separacji, czyli oddzielnego mieszkania, to ich małżeństwo – Sakramentalne Przymierze małżonków z Bogiem – trwa nadal. Nadal są mężem i żoną i jako tacy staną przed Bogiem. Sakrament małżeństwa jest darem Boga, który daje małżonkom siłę odtwarzania wspólnoty małżeńskiej właściwie w każdej sytuacji”[108] .

Antyhumanistyczny moralny szantaż to tradycyjne narzędzie katolickiej populistycznej prawicy, z którym mierzą się kolejne pokolenia demokratów. Z wielu przeczytanych ripost najbardziej wzrusza mnie ta lewicowa, Kuroniowska, ujęta w autobiograficznej Wierze i winie: „Skoro bowiem całe zło świata czynią ludzie ludziom, to zdaje się być oczywiste, że w ludzkiej mocy jest tak urządzić swoje społeczne stosunki, aby raz na zawsze znieść wszelkie zło. Ten cel – królestwo wolności – w moim przekazie rodzinnym, a jak się zdaje w ogóle w etosie lewicy – jawi się jako odległa perspektywa, dostępna dopiero przyszłym pokoleniom. Obecnie należałoby tej przyszłości służyć, to jest przede wszystkim sprzeciwiać się wszelkiej krzywdzie człowieka. […] Z nakazu obrony krzywdzonych wyrasta wrażliwość na przeżycia innych ludzi i to właśnie drugi człowiek, przede wszystkim słaby i krzywdzony, jest w duchowości lewicy przeżywany jako sacrum. To dla niego ma być królestwo wolności. Z tego punktu widzenia chybiona jest, prowadzona przeważnie z pozycji chrześcijańskich, krytyka lewicowego ubóstwienia człowieka, opiera się ona bowiem na milczącym założeniu, że stawiany na piedestał człowiek to «ja». Równość ludzi jako wartość – dyrektywę moralną lewicy – należy rozpatrywać w kontekście podstawowego dla tej duchowości wymogu aktywnego stosunku do krzywdy drugiego człowieka – sacrum”.

Teoretycznie „autonomiczne” państwo odprowadza też co roku rosnącą kwotę na Fundusz Kościelny, który od kilkunastu lat zwyczajnie nie powinien istnieć. Dla przypomnienia: Fundusz powstał w 1950 roku jako rekompensata za to, że państwo odebrało Kościołom nieruchomości i ziemie po wprowadzeniu ustawy o przejęciu dóbr martwej ręki. W 1989 roku powstała jednak słynna państwowo-kościelna Komisja Majątkowa, która w ciągu dwóch kolejnych dziesięcioleci przekazała Kościołowi tyle ziemi i nieruchomości, że stał się największym właścicielem gruntów w Polsce (według danych Ministerstwa Skarbu Państwa w 2014 było to 0,44 procenta powierzchni Polski, z czego drobna część należy do innych Kościołów). Działalność Komisji opisywały właściwie wszystkie media, bo stała się symbolem bezsilności państwa w nierównym dialogu z Kościołem katolickim.

Kiedy protest się rozpoczął, Kościół wsparł rząd, oddając mu do dyspozycji katechetów, którym biskupi wyznaczyli do odegrania niechlubną rolę łamistrajków. Przy wymownym milczeniu Episkopatu biskupi poszczególnych kurii przestrzegali katechetów przed angażowaniem się w akcje „wrogo nastawionego do Kościoła ZNP”. W niektórych diecezjach grozili zwolnieniami, w innych obłudnie przekonywali, że „pozostawanie na uboczu nie może być odbierane jako objaw łamistrajku”. Dzięki tej ogólnopolskiej akcji ministrowie „dobrej zmiany” mogli z pomocą usłużnych księży i zakonnic, a także zmodyfikowanego na kolanie prawa zignorować protestujących w okresie egzaminów gimnazjalnych. Na podstawie rozporządzenia ministry Zalewskiej do zespołów egzaminacyjnych mogli dołączyć przypadkowi ludzie, o ile legitymowali się jakimikolwiek kwalifikacjami pedagogicznymi. Polskę obiegły zdjęcia księży i zakonnic pilnujących egzaminowanych dzieci – spełniony sen Episkopatu o szkole publicznej.

Niechęć Kościoła do nauczycieli i szkoły ma oczywiste uzasadnienie. Dobrzy nauczyciele nie uczą dzieci posłuszeństwa i milczenia, tylko samodzielnego myślenia, obywatelskiej aktywności i niezależności, a dobry program szkolny przekazuje dzieciom wiedzę naukową o człowieku i świecie, która falsyfikuje twierdzenia tak zwanej „nauki Kościoła”.

Szkolna wersja opowieści o polskim papieżu jest emblematycznym przykładem zamieniania historii w politykę historyczną, która w tym wypadku służy uzasadnieniu roszczeń Kościoła do współrządzenia Polską. Jan Paweł II niewątpliwie był ważną i zasłużoną postacią dla Polski (i dla pozycji Kościoła w Polsce), ale w dobrej publicznej szkole uczniowie dowiedzieliby się także o podnoszonych na całym świecie wątpliwościach dotyczących jego trwającej kilka dziesięcioleci kompletnej i zaskakującej u przywódcy państwa niewiedzy dotyczącej skandali pedofilskich rozgrywających się w wielu krajach, w tym również z udziałem osób z jego najbliższego otoczenia (jak notoryczny gwałciciel dzieci Marcial Maciel Degollado, założyciel Legionu Chrystusa, którego Jan Paweł II uznawał za swojego przyjaciela). Usłyszeliby też o zastrzeżeniach dotyczących jego ultrakonserwatywnego stosunku do praw kobiet i do pozycji kobiet w Kościele, o zakazaniu katolikom używania prezerwatyw w ogarniętej śmiertelną epidemią AIDS Afryce czy nakłanianiu krzywdzonych podczas konfliktu bałkańskiego kobiet do rodzenia dzieci z gwałtu. Mogliby też obejrzeć słynne zdjęcia polskiego papieża z dyktatorem Augusto Pinochetem i omówić relacje Watykanu z chilijskim reżimem. Usłyszeliby też, że w zamian za pomoc dla Polski w czasach komunizmu III Rzeczpospolita zapłaciła Janowi Pawłowi II i jego Kościołowi licznymi przywilejami podatkowymi, nieruchomościami i ziemią, prawami reprodukcyjnymi kobiet i otwarciem drzwi do szkół.

W dużej mierze to jej refleksji na temat rodziny kobiety na całym świecie zawdzięczają anachroniczną i uprzedmiotawiającą je politykę polskiego papieża, objawiającą się między innymi takimi działaniami jak jego niesławny list do arcybiskupa Sarajewa Vinko Puljicia, w którym nakazywał zgwałconym w czasie wojny kobietom rodzić dzieci poczęte w wyniku gwałtów, czy dokument Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, w którym papież stanowczo ukrócił marzenia katoliczek o kapłaństwie, ponieważ nie widział żadnego powodu, żeby kobiety współrządziły wielomilionową wspólnotą wiernych, co najmniej w połowie składającą się z kobiet właśnie.

Jako przykład sytuacji, której dzięki katolickiemu projektowi będzie można uniknąć, podano między innymi sprawę P. i S. przeciwko Polsce (nr skargi 57375 / 08). Przypomnijmy: sprawa dotyczyła dziewczynki, która zaszła w ciążę w wieku 14 lat – a więc w wyniku czynu zabronionego – i której odmawiano przeprowadzenia legalnej aborcji. W wyroku z 2012 roku Europejski Trybunał Praw Człowieka stwierdził, że Polska złamała zakaz tortur, nieludzkiego i poniżającego traktowania (art. 3 Europejskiej Konwencji Praw Człowieka) oraz prawo dziewczynki i jej matki do poszanowania ich życia prywatnego i rodzinnego (art. 8 EKPC). Trybunał orzekł też, że umieszczenie dziewczynki w placówce opiekuńczo-wychowawczej stanowiło naruszenie prawa skarżącej do wolności i bezpieczeństwa osobistego.

Nie pojmujecie, jak ograniczenie dostępu kobiet do służby zdrowia i wiedzy może być dobre dla dzieci? To proste. Z raportu Światowej Organizacji Zdrowia (WHO) wynika, że w krajach, gdzie dostępna jest edukacja seksualna, środki antykoncepcyjne i legalna aborcja, przeprowadza się o wiele mniej zabiegów przerywania ciąży, rodzi się również mniej dzieci i o wiele mniej z nich zostaje później sierotami. Z drugiej strony raport WHO informuje też, że w krajach rozwijających się, gdzie prawo jest bardziej restrykcyjne, na skutek komplikacji po nielegalnej aborcji co osiem minut umiera kobieta, dwieście dwadzieścia tysięcy dzieci każdego roku zostaje sierotami, a pięć milionów kobiet rocznie trafia do szpitala z na tyle poważnymi komplikacjami po nielegalnym zabiegu, że ograniczają one ich życiową aktywność.

Muszę Panu powiedzieć, że postawa tych tak zwanych mądrych księży spod znaku Kościoła otwartego budzi moje szczególne wątpliwości. Z jednej strony, ponieważ sami nie wypowiadają fundamentalistycznych treści, służą jako knebel wkładany w usta wszystkim, którzy głośno krytykują zło w Kościele i domagają się reformy tej instytucji („przecież Kościół to też oni”). Z drugiej strony, ponieważ milczą też wobec fundamentalistycznych wypowiedzi i zapędów swoich zwierzchników, nie powstrzymują zła w Kościele. Czy gdybym uczciwie pracowała w jakiejś instytucji, a jednocześnie wiedziałabym, że w pokoju obok inny pracownik molestuje dziecko, a szefowie o tym wiedzą i nic nie robią, i gdybym nie reagowała na ten stan rzeczy, to zasługiwałabym na miano mądrej osoby, do której matki powinny wysyłać swoje dzieci?

„Często wyzwala się ta niewłaściwa postawa czy nadużycie, kiedy dziecko szuka miłości. Ono lgnie, ono szuka. I zagubi się samo, i jeszcze tego drugiego człowieka wciąga” (abp Michalik, 2013). „Żadna siła nie powstrzyma człowieka od tego, żeby korzystać z możliwości, jakie daje człowiekowi wolna wola i do czego pchają go namiętności” (bp Pieronek, 2013). „... również arcybiskup pedofil powinien być szanowany, jeśli wszystkich ludzi mamy szanować, a nie linczować” (bp Pieronek, 2013). „Pedofilii są winne feministki i brak miłości rozwodzących się rodziców” (abp Michalik 2013). „Kościół jest atakowany również za to, że jego przedstawiciele nie są donosicielami i nie przekazują informacji na temat pedofilii do odpowiednich instancji” (bp Dydycz, 2013). „Problem pedofilii w dzisiejszym niesłychanie rozerotyzowanym społeczeństwie narasta. (...) I nie wiem, czy społeczeństwa będą w stanie opanować takie zjawisko wobec tej kultury, która teraz jest dominująca” (abp Hoser, 2017). „Powiem ofiarom, że świat się nie kończy na grzechu, że jest coś ważniejszego aniżeli grzech, że istnieje i odkupienie, i przebaczenie, i możliwość tego, co nazywamy cierpieniem za kogoś innego” (Gądecki, 2018).

Tak było w szczegółowo opisanej przez OKO.PRESS sprawie księdza Piotra D., proboszcza w niewielkiej wsi należącej do archidiecezji warszawskiej. Proboszcz był też katechetą i przez cztery lata molestował chłopca, którego przygotowywał do komunii. Sąd w 2007 roku skazał go za to na cztery lata więzienia. Rok później sąd apelacyjny zmienił jednak karę na wyrok w zawieszeniu. „Sąd zaufał kurii warszawskiej, która zobowiązała się do «bezwzględnego i skutecznego nadzoru» nad księdzem. Na czele kurii stał już wtedy arcybiskup Kazimierz Nycz, metropolita warszawski. Umieścił duchownego w Pilaszkowie pod Warszawą, w ośrodku podlegającym archidiecezji – jak referowali dziennikarze Daniel Flis i Sebastian Klauziński. – Tam, mimo zapewnień o nadzorze, ks. Piotr D. przez kolejne dwa lata molestował małoletnich chłopców i obcował z nimi płciowo. Wszystko uwieczniał na zdjęciach i filmach”. Do więzienia – na trzy lata i sześć miesięcy – trafił dopiero w 2011 roku, kiedy wyszło na jaw, jak intensywnie korzystał z zaoferowanej mu przez kurię drugiej szansy.

Jedni mają nałóg palenia, inni muszą się wyżyć”. [Chodzi o największy skandal związany z pedofilią księży we Włoszech. Oskarżenia dotyczyły księży pracujących od lat 50. do 80. w Instytucie im. Antonia Provolo w Weronie, gdzie niesłyszące i głuchonieme dzieci z ubogich rodzin zdobywały podstawową edukację. Księża gwałcili wielokrotnie kilkadziesiąt dzieci, które nie były w stanie poskarżyć się rodzicom – najmłodsze ofiary miały sześć lat – przyp. red.].

Nie mówiąc o stałym zwalczaniu praw kobiet czy zdobyczy medycyny. Polskie dzieci nie dowiedzą się o tym w szkole, która zresztą staje się coraz bardziej bezbronna wobec kościelnej obecności i indoktrynacji.

Umowny początek neoliberalnych przemian kapitalizmu wyznacza kryzys lat 70. w gospodarce globalnej. Doprowadził on do złożonych zmian ekonomicznych, politycznych i społecznych, w socjologii określanych wielorako: przejściem od epoki przemysłowej do postindustrializmu[8], od fordyzmu do postfordyzmu[9], od kapitalizmu zorganizowanego do zdezorganizowanego[10] czy też jako pojawienie się reżimu elastycznej akumulacji[11] lub nowego kapitalizmu[12]. Choć autorów tych pojęć wiele dzieli, to w ich opisie przemian kapitalizmu drugiej połowy XX wieku odnaleźć można wiele wspólnych elementów.

Przede wszystkim kryzys lat 70. sprzyjał wyostrzeniu krytyki dotychczasowej polityki ekonomicznej keynesizmu i rehabilitacji zmarginalizowanej kilka dekad wcześniej doktryny ekonomicznego liberalizmu, która zasadzała się między innymi na przekonaniu, że dla wzrostu gospodarczego kluczowe jest nie tyle wzmacnianie siły nabywczej obywateli, ile tworzenie warunków pozwalających przedsiębiorcom na maksymalizację zysków.

w 1988 roku wydano zgodę na tworzenie prywatnych spółek z elementów majątku przedsiębiorstw państwowych. Dążono w ten sposób do zwiększenia efektywności produkcji i konkurencyjności[38]. Kilka miesięcy później rząd Mieczysława Rakowskiego zainicjował liberalizację gospodarki w wyniku przyjęcia w grudniu 1988 ustawy, która stwierdzała, że „podejmowanie i prowadzenie działalności gospodarczej jest wolne i dozwolone każdemu na równych prawach”[39]. Pociągnęła ona za sobą zjawisko nazywane „prywatyzacją nomenklaturową” (kontrolowaną lub menedżerską), charakterystyczne dla wstępnej fazy przekształceń własnościowych w krajach socjalistycznych. Elita przemysłowa tworzyła spółki, przejmując część aktywów zarządzanych przez siebie przedsiębiorstw[40]. Według krytyków tej formy prywatyzacji była ona „grabieżą mienia państwowego przez własnych menedżerów”

W czasie okupacji jeździłam codziennie z mamą do pracy, bo zaprowadzała mnie do przedszkola wedlowskiego. Ono było luksusowo prowadzone, miało swoją stołówkę, Wedel zatrudniał fachowe siły. Pamiętam nawet dentystkę, jak u niej na fotelu siedziałam. Wedel, jak już coś robił, to na bardzo dobrym poziomie. I ponieważ niektóre dzieci były ciut starsze, to później zorganizował szkołę. Przychodzili pierwszorzędni nauczyciele, tak że jak się wojna skończyła, to ja już byłam przygotowana do trzeciej klasy szkoły powszechnej.

Wprowadzili zachodni system pracy, moim zdaniem bardzo dobry. W starych czasach przychodziły wytyczne z ministerstwa przez Zjednoczenie, później Zrzeszenie Przemysłu Cukierniczego, no i poza tym robiło się na gorąco, co było potrzeba. Natomiast PepsiCo jak przyszło, natychmiast wprowadziło zadaniowy system pracy. Dawali konkretne zadania na jakiś termin, potem trzeba się z tego sprawozdać, co się zrobiło, czego się nie zrobiło, dlaczego. I co pół roku ocena. Nawet sobie zachowałam taką jedną ocenę mojej osoby. Ludzie zaczęli się starać, bo wiedzieli, czego konkretnie od nich się oczekuje, że jest ocena i od niej zależy podwyżka.

Denerwuję się, jak dzisiaj słyszę, że wtedy nic nie było. Ja rozumiem ludzi, którzy na tamtym etapie zarabiali tysiąc złotych, że im było trudno, ale to nie tak, że nic nie było. Było u prywatnych. Pewnie, że czasem trzeba było poczekać, ale można było to kupić. Nikt mi nie załatwiał łóżeczka, wózka, wyposażenia, a jak się syn miał urodzić, wszystko kupiliśmy. Były problemy z aprowizacją, ale na święta zawsze był pełen stół u każdego, bo to tak w tradycji polskiej. Ludzie albo wystawali w kolejce, albo załatwiali na wsi.

Jak zostało wszystko oczyszczone z winogron, to zostały same zakłady. I wtedy nastąpił podział. Milanówek został sprzedany już wcześniej, produkcję krówek przeniesiono, a potem zaniechano jej w ogóle. A wtedy wydzielono cztery zakłady: Delicje, Frito Lay, Syrena i Wedel. To był trudny czas, chyba najtrudniejszy. Bo okres prywatyzacji Wedla, chociaż niósł wiele rozterek, pretensji i takich nie-wiadomo-w-którym-kierunku-pójść, to była nadzieja, że się zmieni na lepsze. Natomiast w tym okresie już było widać, że to jest rozczłonkowywanie i gdzieś tam w perspektywie lat zgubienie marki.

Najlepiej mi się pracowało do momentu prywatyzacji. Mimo że to był okres komunistyczny, to mi się kojarzy z wykonywaniem zawodu. Robiłem to, czego byłem nauczony, co sobie wybrałem i co mi się bardzo podobało. I te czasy komunistyczne, jak by nie patrzeć złe, ale dla pracowników ta praca była na tyle dobrodziejstwem, że nie tylko zarobek dawała, ale jeszcze dostęp do lekarzy, do ośrodków wczasowych, sanatoriów i wszystkich tych osłon socjalnych, które państwo zapewniało. Ten okres miał swoje wady, ale miał bardzo dużo zalet, i to często się powtarza w sondażach, nawet w tych prawicowych. U nas w zakładzie to się dobrze pamięta. Teraz jest walka o pieniądz i o osiągnięcia.

W 1964 zostałem głównym inżynierem wykonawstwa inwestycji. Zakład został uruchomiony i co kilka miesięcy wzywali mnie do Zjednoczenia Przemysłu Papierniczego albo przyjeżdżali do mnie i proponowali mi stanowisko dyrektora. W różnych zakładach, między innymi i w Kwidzynie. Potem mnie nawet minister poprosił do Warszawy na rozmowy. Kilka miałem tych propozycji i w pewnym momencie – oni mieli teczkę z moimi aktami – powiedziałem: „Proszę na mojej teczce napisać «Na dyrektora się nie nadaje»”. Tamten system dla człowieka, który umiał logicznie myśleć, był nie do przyjęcia. Jakiś tam z partii przyjeżdżał i dyktował warunki. To było coś niesamowitego, przecież ja znałem tych ludzi niektórych – tak prymitywni, tak prości, a przed nimi trzeba było prawie że na baczność stać. Ja z tym nie mogłem się pogodzić.

Pamiętam też, to znów była moja polityka – wiedziałem, że my stoimy dobrze, bo koszty spadły, zbyt był duży – żeby płace podnieść. I co jakiś czas robiłem podwyżki. Mnie ulżyło, kiedy wiedziałem, że w województwie bydgoskim na pierwszym miejscu jesteśmy my. To był skok. Jeden z delegatów, już nie pamiętam której firmy zainteresowanej kupnem Celulozy – kiedy byliśmy jeszcze spółką skarbu państwa – pytał: „Czy to prawda, że ma być znów podwyżka płac? Jakie są powody, że pan podnosi płace?”. Mówię: „Firma dobrze prosperuje, ma zysk”. „Proszę pana, pieniądze z zysku to nie dla załogi są, należą się akcjonariuszom”. Ja mówię: „To ja wiem.

Miałem sukcesy, ale z tego początkowego okresu pamiętam też nerwową atmosferę, bo nie było dobrych wyników, bo ciągła awaryjność maszyn, ciągłe problemy techniczne, presja z góry, bo to jakiś sekretarz partii naciskał dyrektora naczelnego, dyrektor naczelny na kogoś; gdzieś ktoś zawsze szukał kozła ofiarnego. Można było pracować dwadzieścia cztery godziny na dobę, a na koniec dnia dowiedzieć się, że jesteś winny, bo maszyna stała trzy godziny z powodu awarii. Przyczyny były gdzie indziej, ale nie można było o tym głośno mówić. Cały system zarządzania gospodarką był winny. Czepiano się ludzi na samym dole, a nie tych, którzy tworzyli ten system. To było najbardziej stresujące, nie problemy techniczne, tylko to ciągłe zakłamanie. Prawie przy każdej awarii pojawiał się oficer Służby Bezpieczeństwa i szukał kogoś, kogo można było oskarżyć o to, że sabotuje, że działa na szkodę państwa.

Jak analizowaliśmy potem efektywność tego procesu, to okazało się, że on nie był bardzo udany z kilku powodów. Rynek pracy był płytki, poza pracą w naszej firmie nie było wiele więcej ofert. Pracownicy byli bardzo mało mobilni. Nie potrafili czy nie chcieli się przemieszczać nawet na odległość do stu kilometrów, nie mówiąc już o większej. Kolejna sprawa była taka, że zarobki u nas były tak wysokie, że jakakolwiek oferta rynku lokalnego nie spotykała się z zainteresowaniem pracowników, ponieważ uważali, że to byłoby hańbiące pójść pracować za tak niskie wynagrodzenie. No i wysokie odprawy, które płaciliśmy, też nie zachęcały ludzi do szukania innego zajęcia. Tak że tylko niewielka część pracowników była rzeczywiście zainteresowana szukaniem innej pracy. Niektóre osoby doświadczyły więc przykrości związanych z utratą pracy i nie znalazły innej. Na pewno było im ciężko, ale być może z perspektywy czasu też znaleźli uzasadnienie i przekonanie, że było to dla dobra ich dzieci, a może wnuków, bo ta praca będzie na dłużej i będzie dla kolejnych pokoleń.

Trzeba podkreślić, że jeżeli my zwiększyliśmy kilkukrotnie obroty, to zwiększyły się również dochody z podatków dla skarbu państwa i dochody gminy. Wynagrodzenia u nas są o co najmniej sześćdziesiąt procent wyższe niż średnia krajowa w grupie przedsiębiorstw. Dobra kondycja spółki to jest ogromna korzyść dla kraju, ogromna korzyść dla regionu, ogromna korzyść dla pracowników i ich rodzin, i również dla osób, które w jakiś sposób pośrednio są z nią związane poprzez świadczenie usług. Nie mam co do tego najmniejszych wątpliwości, że prywatyzacja była bardzo korzystna, potrzebna i dzięki niej przyszłość naprawdę zapowiada się dobrze.

Wezwał mnie do siebie i mówi: „Słuchajcie, słyszeliśmy, że wy tam kapitalistyczny system jakości wdrażacie. Wiadomo, że on w naszych warunkach nie zda egzaminu i powinniśmy stosować swoje metody”. Mówię: „Prawie mnie pan przekonał. Tylko niech pan przekona oponę, żeby ona była dobra na sposób socjalistyczny czy kapitalistyczny. Oni dostarczają system, który ma gwarantować, że ta opona będzie dobra”. „No dobrze, róbcie, co uważacie, tylko nie przesadzajcie”.

Ale jak pojawiła się możliwość zbytu, to postanowiliśmy wrócić do pracy czterobrygadowej na najbardziej potrzebnych liniach. W odpowiedzi na to odezwały się bardzo negatywne głosy, że wracamy do komunistycznych metod eksploatacji pracownika. Wymyśliliśmy, jak wywrzeć nacisk na związkowców. Przyjęliśmy sto pięćdziesiąt osób już pod ten system pracy ciągłej i szkoliliśmy je, ale kontrakt mieli tylko na trzy miesiące. I jak zbliżała się końcówka, to ci ludzie zaczęli przychodzić i pytać, jakie mają szanse przedłużenia umowy. Na to mówię: „No, jeśli związki będą nadal takie nieugięte i nie zgodzą się na pracę w trybie czterozmianowym, to zwolnimy was, nie mamy wyjścia. Jak chcecie, to tam jeden związkowiec jest w pokoju sto pięć, drugi w sto osiem, porozmawiajcie z nimi”. Po tygodniu przyszli do mnie związkowcy i mówią, że oni protestować nie będą, żebym robił swoje.

Ale jeszcze bardziej niż związków bałem się, że księża z ambony mogą to potępić. Więc przy okazji zagadałem arcybiskupa Piszcza, bo się udzielaliśmy w różnych fundacjach: „Wie ksiądz arcybiskup, mamy taki problem, czy to jest etycznie zatrudniać ludzi w niedzielę? Bo z drugiej strony tu jest takie bezrobocie, a można nawet trzysta, czterysta osób więcej zatrudnić, to jednak tyle rodzin będzie miało środki do życia. I – mówię – ciężki wybór”. On mówi: „No, ja bym się jednak opowiedział za tą pracą w niedzielę, jeśli można tyle stanowisk pracy stworzyć”. Poczułem się zabezpieczony.

Cyrankiewicz, który uwielbiał samochody, sam prowadził i nawet uciekał ochroniarzom. Spytał się, czy może się przejechać. Akurat obok jest tor jazdy próbnej. On wsiada do samochodu, zrobił kilka kółek, ale na tym torze jest też taka tarka, która trzęsie samochodem, jak się na nią wjedzie. On właśnie raz, dwa, trzy, i miskę olejową rozwalił, olej się wylał. Głupia sprawa, ale samochód nie naszej konstrukcji. Faktycznie miseczka była na równe autostrady, nisko jak na polskie warunki. Myśmy wtedy szybko poszli do konstruktorów i oni zrobili takie dwie listwy, które zasłoniły tę miskę. Do końca produkcji zostały, nawet Włosi podobno je zastosowali.

W momencie, kiedy uruchamialiśmy Fiata, musieliśmy wynieść Syrenę, bo nie było miejsca na jej produkcję. Nawet pojawił się pomysł, żeby ją zlikwidować, ale władza stanowczo zabroniła. Wtedy Wrzaszczyk udał się do Gierka do Katowic, przywiózł go po cichu do fabryki, oprowadził, po czym cała Syrena została przeniesiona do fabryki w Bielsku-Białej[130]. W momencie, kiedy Gierek doszedł do władzy, ta fabryka była już bardzo rozwinięta. Wtedy od razu zapadła decyzja, że kupujemy licencję na mały samochód, 126p, i uruchamiamy produkcję w Bielsku. Co prawda nasze społeczeństwo było zaskoczone, bo jak był pokaz na placu Defilad, to ludzie przyszli i mówili: o rany boskie, to takie małe, jak tym jeździć. A ten samochód zrobił niesamowitą karierę, bo zmotoryzował Polskę. To była podstawowa zasługa Wrzaszczyka, którego Gierek od razu mianował na ministra.

Ja nie należę do tych ludzi, którzy plują na PRL od A do Z. Zapomina się, że ktoś odbudował Warszawę i wiele innych miast, ktoś zbudował wiele fabryk, hut i tak dalej. Nasza fabryka zbudowała dla pracowników dwa budynki hotelowe, a potem jeszcze trzy dwunastopiętrowe bloki obok Kanału Żerańskiego. Na każdym wydziale czy zakładzie był punkt lekarski, a za bramą fabryki przychodnia lekarska i własny – mały, co prawda – szpitalik. Pamiętam również, że działając społecznie w ówczesnych związkach zawodowych, miałem udział w przydzielaniu mieszkań.

Po drodze przedstawiciele polscy szukali jakiegoś nowego inwestora. Znalazła się firma Magna z Kanady, która produkowała samochody różnych marek. Wszystko zostało dogadane na dziewięćdziesiąt parę procent i został jeden temat: że jak taki inwestor wchodzi, to państwo robi dla niego jakiś gest, w podatkach czy w innych sprawach. Do ministra finansów udała się delegacja. Pytają: „Czy nie mógłby nam pan obniżyć na ileś lat podatku”. A on pyta: „Dlaczego?”. Oni na to, że uruchomiają fabrykę i zatrudniają jakieś trzy tysiące pracowników. A minister na to: „A co nas to obchodzi, my mamy tu w Warszawie 2,4 procent bezrobocia”. Rozmowa skończyła się na niczym i Magna się zwinęła. A za jakieś niecałe trzy miesiące podpisała kontrakt w Kaliningradzie. Inny przykład jest taki, że w Polsce produkcja samochodów przez ostatnie pięć lat spadła o jakieś czterysta tysięcy, z prawie miliona do sześćset tysięcy. Natomiast Węgry nie miały żadnych samochodów osobowych, autobusy Ikarus i nic więcej. Dzisiaj posiadają cztery fabryki samochodów, w tym jedyna fabryka Mercedesa poza Niemcami i w Europie największa fabryka silników Opla. Pytam się, jak reagowały polskie władze, jak mówiły, że niewidzialna ręka wolnego rynku wszystko załatwi. To jest chore pojęcie.

W 1979 roku przyszła ta cholerna zima. Tak straszna, tak nasypało, że ja z ulicy Inflanckiej szedłem na piechotę do FSO środkiem ulicy, w tunelu wygrzebanym w śniegu. Żaden pojazd się nie poruszał, żaden tramwaj. Chodziliśmy do FSO odśnieżać tory, zrzucać śnieg, żeby można było uruchomić dostawy. Kto mógł dojść, to doszedł, kto nie, no to trudno. Na dodatek ta straszna beznadzieja, w sensie zniewolenia umysłowego. Z powodu beznadziejności życia w Polsce nie byłem w stanie oglądać ówczesnej telewizji. Miałem małe załamanie nerwowe. To było po prostu tak dołujące, to szło w tak złym kierunku, tak się ta sytuacja gospodarcza pogarszała, te kłopoty życia codziennego. Nie dało się żyć po prostu. Ja miałem z tym w każdym bądź razie spore problemy. Lekarz mi przepisał środek uspokajający, on mnie oczywiście natychmiast uzależnił. Musiałem pójść do innego lekarza: „Proszę nie brać polskich środków, to się do niczego nie nadaje. Proszę wziąć odpowiednik niemiecki”.

Na marginesie chciałem dodać taką rzecz: w latach 80., kiedy byłem przewodniczącym rady pracowniczej, miałem możliwość wglądu w opracowanie firmy audytorsko-konsultacyjnej Price Waterhouse, które miało za zadanie pokazać strategię rozwoju motoryzacji w Europie. To była bardzo dalekowzroczna koncepcja, która się sprawdziła. Wynikało z niej, że będzie następowała stopniowa koncentracja przemysłu samochodowego i w efekcie powinno w Europie pozostać nie więcej jak pięciu producentów samochodów. Było w niej również napisane, że przemysł samochodowy będzie stopniowo przesuwał się w kierunku Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej i że to będzie Czechosłowacja, natomiast kraje ościenne będą dostarczycielami komponentów samochodowych. I to też się ziściło.

Lata 80. trudne były z tego względu, że nie było pieniędzy na rozwój. Rynki się kurczyły, dewiz nie było. Samochody na rynkach zagranicznych nie chciały się sprzedawać, bo nie było modernizacji. To samo nadwozie od wielu lat było produkowane z niewielkimi tylko zmianami. Nie było zasadniczych zmian, jeśli chodzi o silnik. Tymczasem wchodziły dyrektywy jakościowe, które mówiły, że samochód powinien wytwarzać spaliny o określonym składzie, samochody powinny być niebenzynożerne. A to wymagało dużo nakładów.

One striking illustration of this fact came a few weeks after the murder of the Latin American intellectuals in El Salvador, when Václav Havel visited Washington and addressed a joint session of Congress. Before his enraptured audience, Havel lauded the “defenders of freedom” in Washington who “understood the responsibility that flowed from” being “the most powerful nation on earth”—crucially, their responsibility for the brutal assassination of his Salvadoran counterparts shortly before.

Michael Scheuer, the senior CIA analyst responsible for tracking bin Laden from 1996 to 1999, wrote, “Bin Laden has been precise in telling America the reasons he is waging war on us.” The al-Qaeda leader, Scheuer continued, was “out to drastically alter US and Western policies toward the Islamic world.” And, as Scheuer explains, bin Laden largely succeeded. “US forces and policies are completing the radicalization of the Islamic world, something Osama bin Laden has been trying to do with substantial but incomplete success since the early 1990s. As a result, I think it is fair to conclude that the United States of America remains bin Laden’s only indispensable ally.”

It is common, for example, to read that “the world” fully supported George Bush when he ordered the bombing of Afghanistan. That may be true of “the world,” but hardly of the world, as revealed in an international Gallup poll after the bombing was announced. Global support was slight. In Latin America, which has some experience with U.S. behavior, support ranged from 2 percent in Mexico to 16 percent in Panama, and that support was conditional upon the culprits being identified (they still weren’t eight months later, the FBI reported) and civilian targets being spared (they were attacked at once).

The shock and indignation are understandable—particularly the testimony in the Senate Armed Services Committee report on Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld’s desperation to find links between Iraq and al-Qaeda, links that were later concocted as justification for the invasion.

One distinguished scholar who undertook the task was Hans Morgenthau, a founder of realist international relations theory. In a classic study published in 1964 in the glow of Kennedy’s Camelot, Morgenthau developed the standard view that the United States has a “transcendent purpose”: establishing peace and freedom at home and indeed everywhere, since “the arena within which the United States must defend and promote its purpose has become world-wide.” But as a scrupulous scholar, he also recognized that the historical record was radically inconsistent with that “transcendent purpose.”3 We should not be misled by that discrepancy,

An argument can be made that implementation of the CIA’s “torture paradigm” never violated the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, at least as Washington interpreted it. McCoy points out that the highly sophisticated CIA paradigm, developed at enormous cost in the 1950s and 1960s and based on “the KGB’s most devastating torture technique,” kept primarily to mental torture, not crude physical torture, which was considered less effective in turning people into pliant vegetables.

There is much debate about whether torture has been effective in eliciting information—the assumption being, apparently, that if it is effective then it may be justified. By this argument, when Nicaragua captured U.S. pilot Eugene Hasenfus in 1986, after shooting down his plane as it delivered aid to U.S.-supported Contra forces, they should not have tried him, found him guilty, and then sent him back to the United States, as they did. Instead, they should have applied the CIA torture paradigm to try to extract information about other terrorist atrocities being planned and implemented in Washington—no small matter for a tiny, impoverished country under terrorist attack by the global superpower.

The United States and its Western allies are sure to do whatever they can to prevent authentic democracy in the Arab world. To understand why, it is only necessary to look at the studies of Arab opinion conducted by U.S. polling agencies. Though barely reported, they are certainly known to planners. They reveal that by overwhelming majorities, Arabs regard the United States and Israel as the major threats they face: the United States is so regarded by 90 percent of Egyptians and by over 75 percent of the inhabitants of the region generally. By way of contrast, 10 percent of Arabs regard Iran as a threat. Opposition to U.S. policy is so strong that a majority believes security would be improved if Iran had nuclear weapons—in Egypt, 80 percent.9 Other figures are similar. If public opinion were to influence policy, the United States not only would not control the region but would be expelled from it, along with its allies, undermining fundamental principles of global dominance.

Post–Civil War amendments extended the concept of personhood to African-Americans, ending slavery—in theory, at least. After about a decade of relative freedom, a condition akin to slavery was reintroduced by a North-South compact permitting the effective criminalization of black life. A black male standing on a street corner could be arrested for vagrancy, or for attempted rape if accused of looking at a white woman the wrong way. And once imprisoned, he had few chances of ever escaping the system of “slavery by another name,” the term used by then Wall Street Journal bureau chief Douglas Blackmon in an arresting study.

In societies where indigenous populations have influence, many are taking a strong stand. The strongest stance of any country with regard to global warming is that of Bolivia, which has an indigenous majority and constitutional requirements that protect the “rights of nature.” Ecuador, which also has a large indigenous population, is the only oil exporter I know of whose government is seeking aid to help keep that oil in the ground instead of producing and exporting it—and the ground is where it ought to be.

In 2015, China also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), with itself as the main shareholder. Fifty-six nations participated in the opening in Beijing in June, including U.S. allies Australia, Britain, and others which joined in defiance of Washington’s wishes. The United States and Japan were absent. Some analysts believe that the new bank might turn out to be a competitor to the Bretton Woods institutions (the IMF and the World Bank), in which the United States holds veto power. There are also some expectations that the SCO might eventually become a counterpart to NATO.

As Greenspan explained during his glory days, his successful policies were based substantially on “greater worker insecurity.” Intimidated workers would not ask for higher wages or benefits, but would accept lower living standards in exchange for being able to keep a job at all. By neoliberal standards, this added up to a “quite favorable … healthy economic performance.”

one of the difficulties in arousing American concern about global warming is that some 40 percent of the country’s population believes that Jesus Christ will probably or definitely return to Earth by 2050, so they do not see the very severe threats of climate disaster in future decades as a problem. A similar percentage believes that our planet was created just a few thousand years ago.

We thus think about imprisonment as a fate reserved for others, a fate reserved for the “evildoers,” to use a term recently popularized by George W. Bush. Because of the persistent power of racism, “criminals” and “evildoers” are, in the collective imagination, fantasized as people of color. The prison therefore functions ideologically as an abstract site into which undesirables are deposited, relieving us of the responsibility of thinking about the real issues afflicting those communities from which prisoners are drawn in such disproportionate numbers. This is the ideological work that the prison performs—it relieves us of the responsibility of seriously engaging with the problems of our society, especially those produced by racism and, increasingly, global capitalism.

Exploring such connections may offer us a different perspective on the current state of the punishment industry. If we are already persuaded that racism should not be allowed to define the planet’s future and if we can successfully argue that prisons are racist institutions, this may lead us to take seriously the prospect of declaring prisons obsolete.

Historian Adam Jay Hirsch has pointed out: One may perceive in the penitentiary many reflections of chattel slavery as it was practiced in the South. Both institutions subordinated their subjects to the will of others. Like Southern slaves, prison inmates followed a daily routine specified by their superiors. Both institutions reduced their subjects to dependence on others for the supply of basic human services such as food and shelter. Both isolated their subjects from the general population by confining them to a fixed habitat. And both frequently coerced their subjects to work, often for longer hours and for less compensation than free laborers.

In the immediate aftermath of slavery, the southern states hastened to develop a criminal justice system that could legally restrict the possibilities of freedom for newly released slaves. Black people became the prime targets of a developing convict lease system, referred to by many as a reincarnation of slavery. The Mississippi Black Codes, for example, declared vagrant “anyone/who was guilty of theft, had run away [from a job, apparently], was drunk, was wanton in conduct or speech, had neglected job or family, handled money carelessly, and . . . all other idle and disorderly persons.”19 Thus, vagrancy was coded as a black crime, one punishable by incarceration and forced labor, sometimes on the very plantations that previously had thrived on slave labor.

The appalling treatment to which convicts were subjected under the lease system recapitulated and further extended the regimes of slavery. If, as Adam Jay Hirsch contends, the early incarnations of the U.S. penitentiary in the North tended to mirror the institution of slavery in many important respects, the post-Civil War evolution of the punishment system was in very literal ways the continuation of a slave system, which was no longer legal in the “free” world.

Prior to the appearance of punitive incarceration, such punishment was designed to have its most profound effect not so much on the person punished as on the crowd of spectators. Punishment was, in essence, public spectacle. Reformers such as John Howard in England and Benjamin Rush in Pennsylvania argued that punishment—if carried out in isolation, behind the walls of the prison—would cease to be revenge and would actually reform those who had broken the law.

Between 1787 and 1791, the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham published his letters on a prison model he called the panopticon.45 Bentham claimed that criminals could only internalize productive labor habits if they were under constant surveillance. According to his panopticon model, prisoners were to be housed in single cells on circular tiers, all facing a multilevel guard tower.

If we combine Howard’s emphasis on disciplined self-reflection with Bentham’s ideas regarding the technology of internalization designed to make surveillance and discipline the purview of the individual prisoner, we can begin to see how such a conception of the prison had far-reaching implications. The conditions of possibility for this new form of punishment were strongly anchored in a historical era during which the working class needed to be constituted as an army of self-disciplined individuals capable of performing the requisite industrial labor for a developing capitalist system.

Bender argues that the novel helped facilitate these campaigns to transform the old prisons—which were filthy and in disarray, and which thrived on the bribery of the wardens—into well-ordered rehabilitative penitentiaries. He shows that novels such as Moll Flanders and Robinson Crusoe emphasized “the power of confinement to reshape personalityʺ57 and popularized some of the ideas that moved reformers to action. As Bender points out, the eighteenth-century reformers criticized the old prisons for their chaos, their lack of organization and classification, for the easy circulation of alcohol and prostitution they permitted, and for the prevalence of contagion and disease.

Moreover, as Lucia Zedner has pointed out, sentencing practices for women within the reformatory system often required women of all racial backgrounds to do more time than men for similar offenses. “This differential was justified on the basis that women were sent to reformatories not to be punished in proportion to the seriousness of their offense but to be reformed and retrained, a process that, it was argued, required time.”

Luana Ross’s study of Native American women incarcerated in the Women’s Correctional Center in Montana argues that “prisons, as employed by the Euro-American system, operate to keep Native Americans in a colonial situation.”87 She points out that Native people are vastly overrepresented in the country’s federal and state prisons. In Montana, where she did her research, they constitute 6 percent of the general population, but 17.3 percent of the imprisoned population. Native women are even more disproportionately present in Montana’s prison system. They constitute 25 percent of all women imprisoned by the state.88 Thirty years ago, around the time of the Attica uprising and the murder of George Jackson at San Quentin, radical opposition to the prison system identified it as a principal site of state violence and repression. In part as a reaction to the invisibility of women prisoners in this movement and in part as a consequence of the rising women’s liberation movement, specific campaigns developed in defense of the rights of women prisoners. Many of these campaigns put forth—and continue to advance—radical critiques of state repression and violence. Within the correctional community, however, feminism has been influenced largely by liberal constructions of gender equality. In contrast to the nineteenth-century reform movement, which was grounded in an ideology of gender difference, late-twentieth-century “reforms” have relied on a “separate but equal” model.

Socialist theory up to now declared that the point of departure for a transformation to Socialism would be a general and catastrophic crisis. We must distinguish in this outlook two things: the fundamental idea and its exterior form. The fundamental idea consists of the affirmation that capitalism, as a result of its own inner contradictions, moves toward a point when it will be unbalanced, when it will simply become impossible. There were good reasons for conceiving that juncture in the form of a catastrophic general commercial crisis. But that is of secondary importance when the fundamental idea is considered.

The scientific basis of Socialism rests, as is well known, on three principal results of capitalist development. First, on the growing anarchy of capitalist economy, leading inevitably to its ruin. Second, on the progressive socialization of the process of production, which creates the germs of the future social order. And third, on the increased organization and consciousness of the proletarian class, which constitutes the active factor in the coming revolution.

Revisionist theory thus places itself in a dilemma. Either the Socialist transformation is, as was admitted up to now, the consequence of the internal contradictions of capitalism, and with the growth of capitalism will develop its inner contradictions, resulting inevitably, at some point, in its collapse, (in that case the “means of adaptation” are ineffective and the theory of collapse is correct); or the “means of adaptation” will really stop the collapse of the capitalist system and thereby enable capitalism to maintain itself by suppressing its own contradictions. In that case Socialism ceases to be an historic necessity. It then becomes anything you want to call it, but it is no longer the result of the material development of society.

The production relations of capitalist society approach more and more the production relations of Socialist society. But on the other hand, its political and juridical relations establish between capitalist society and Socialist society a steadily rising wall. This wall is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened and consolidated by the development of social reforms and the course of democracy. Only the hammer blow of revolution, that is to say, the conquest of political power by the proletariat can break down this wall.

It is not true that Socialism will arise automatically from the daily struggle of the working class.

And it is precisely crises that constitute the other consequence of the same process. As a result of their periodic depreciation of capital, crises bring a fall in the prices of means of production, a paralysis of a part of the active capital, and in time the increase of profits. They thus create the possibilities of the renewed advance of production. Crises therefore appear to be the instruments of rekindling the fire of capitalist development. Their cessation—not temporary cessation, but their total disappearance in the world market—would not lead to the further development of capitalist economy. It would destroy capitalism.

Here, too, the theoretic base of his economic error is his “popularization” of Socialism. For this is what he does. By transporting the concept of capitalism from its productive relations to property relations, and by speaking of simple individuals instead of speaking of entrepreneurs, he moves the question of Socialism from the domain of production into the domain of relations of fortune—that is, from the relation between Capital and Labor to the relation between poor and rich.

For he refers to cooperatives and trade unions as a means of reducing the profit of the capitalists and thus enriching the workers. In this way, he renounces the struggle against the capitalist mode of production and attempts to direct the Socialist movement to struggle against “capitalist distribution.”7 Again and again, Bernstein refers to Socialism as an effort toward a “just,” “juster and still more just” mode of distribution.

It cannot be denied that the direct cause leading the popular masses into the Socialist movement is precisely the “unjust” mode of distribution characteristic of capitalism. When the Social Democracy struggles for the socialization of the entire economy, it aspires therewith also to a “just” distribution of the social wealth. But, guided by Marx’s observation that the mode of distribution of a given epoch is a natural consequence of the mode of production of that epoch, the Social Democracy does not struggle against distribution in the framework of capitalist production.

That is why people who pronounce themselves in favor of the method of legislative reform in place of and in contradistinction to the conquest of political power and social revolution, do not really choose a more tranquil, calmer and slower road to the same goal, but a different goal. Instead of taking a stand for the establishment of a new society they take a stand for surface modifications of the old society. If we follow the political conceptions of revisionism, we arrive at the same conclusion that is reached when we follow the economic theories of revisionism. Our program becomes not the realization of Socialism, but the reform of capitalism; not the suppression of the system of wage labor, but the diminution of exploitation, that is, the suppression of the abuses of capitalism instead of the suppression of capitalism itself.

If democracy has become superfluous or annoying to the bourgeoisie, it is on the contrary necessary and indispensable to the working class. It is necessary to the working class because it creates the political forms (autonomous administration, electoral rights, etc.) which will serve the proletariat as fulcrums in its task of transforming bourgeois society. Democracy is indispensable to the working class, because only through the exercise of its democratic rights, in the struggle for democracy, can the proletariat become aware of its class interests and its historic task.

Social Democratic centralism cannot be based on the mechanical subordination and blind obedience of the party membership to the leading party center. For this reason, the Social Democratic movement cannot allow the erection of an air-tight partition between the class-conscious nucleus of the proletariat already in the party and its immediate popular environment, the nonparty sections of the proletariat. Now the two principles on which Lenin’s centralism rests are precisely these: 1. The blind subordination, in the smallest detail, of all party organs, to the party center, which alone thinks, guides, and decides for all. 2. The rigorous separation of the organized nucleus of revolutionaries from its social-revolutionary surroundings. Such centralism is a mechanical transposition of the organizational principles of Blanquism into the mass movement of the Socialist working class.

The fact is that the Social Democracy is not joined to the organization of the proletariat. It is itself the proletariat. And because of this, Social Democratic centralism is essentially different from Blanquist centralism. It can only be the concentrated will of the individuals and groups representative of the most class-conscious, militant, advanced sections of the working class. It is, so to speak, the “self-centralism” of the advanced sectors of the proletariat. It is the rule of the majority within its own party.

The January strikes of 1905 ended victoriously almost throughout. As proof of this, some date from the enormous, and still for the most part inaccessible, mass of material may be cited here relating to a few of the most important strikes carried through in Warsaw alone by the Social Democrats of Poland and Lithuania. In the great factories of the metal industry of Warsaw: Lilpop, Ld.; Rau and Lowenstein; Rudzki and Co.; Borman, Schwede and Co.; Handtke, Gerlach and Pulst; Geisler Bros.; Eberherd, Wolski and Co.; Konrad and Yarnuszkiewicz, Ld.; Weber and Daehn; Ewizdzinski and Co.; Wolonowski Wire Works; Gostynski and Co., Ld.; Rrun and Son; Fraget Norblin; Werner; Buch; Kenneberg Bros.; Labor; Dittmar Lamp Factory; Serkowski; Weszyzki—twenty-two factories in all, the workers won, after a strike of from four to five weeks (from January 25 and 26) a nine-hour day, a 25 percent increase of wages and obtained various smaller concessions.

When, to be sure, the representatives of our German opportunism hear of “revolution,” they immediately think of bloodshed, street fighting, or powder and shot, and the logical conclusion thereof is: the mass strike leads inevitably to the revolution, therefore we dare not have it. In actual fact we see in Russia that almost every mass strike in the long run leads to an encounter with the armed guardians of Czarist order, and therein the so-called political strikes exactly resemble the larger economic struggles. The revolution, however, is something other and something more than bloodshed. In contradiction to the police interpretation, which views the revolution exclusively from the standpoint of street disturbances and rioting, that is, from the standpoint of “disorder”—the interpretation of scientific Socialism sees in the revolution above all a thoroughgoing internal reversal of social class relations. And from this standpoint an altogether different connection exists between revolution and mass strike in Russia from that contained in the commonplace conception that the mass strike generally ends in bloodshed.

Having simulated the accountability of politicians to citizens in the 1990s, we argue, the Kremlin today has lost all interest in democratic charades. Instead of pretending to imitate America’s domestic political system, Putin and his entourage prefer to imitate the way America illicitly interferes in the domestic politics of other countries. More generally, the Kremlin aims to hold up a mirror in which America can contemplate its own proclivity to violate the international rules it pretends to respect.

Trump won both popular and business support by declaring the United States to be the greatest loser from the Americanization of the world. Significant public acceptance of this deviation from the boastful mainstream of American political culture cries out for an explanation. Because Russians and Central Europeans reject imitation as bad for the imitators and good only for the imitated, it is at first puzzling that some Americans would reject imitation as bad for the imitated and good only for the imitators. Indeed, Trump’s resentment against a world full of countries that seek to emulate America seems anomalous until we realize that, for his American supporters, imitators are threats because they are trying to replace the model they imitate. This fear of being supplanted and dispossessed has two sources: immigrants, on the one hand, and China, on the other.

The white voter’s perception that China is stealing American jobs and the business community’s perception that China is stealing American technology helped Trump’s eccentric message of American victimization – despite its being a radical break from the country’s traditional self-image – gain a crude plausibility that it had never previously enjoyed.

Contrary to many contemporary theorists,41 populist rage is directed less at multiculturalism than at post-national individualism and cosmopolitanism. This is an important point politically because, if accepted, it implies that populism cannot be combatted by abandoning identity politics in the name of liberal individualism. For the illiberal democrats of Eastern and Central Europe, the gravest threat to the survival of the white Christian majority in Europe is the incapacity of Western societies to defend themselves.

The old German question revolved around the idea that Germany was too small for the world and too big for Europe. The new German question is different. In the post-Cold War world, it turns out that Germany’s transition to liberal democracy was too unique and path-dependent to be imitated by countries inhospitable, given their own recent histories, to the very idea of a post-ethnic society.

The situation, Dear Friends, is that there are those who want to take our country from us. Not with the stroke of a pen, as happened one hundred years ago at Trianon; now they want us to voluntarily hand our country over to others, over a period of a few decades. They want us to hand it over to foreigners coming from other continents, who do not speak our language, and who do not respect our culture, our laws or our way of life: people who want to replace what is ours with what is theirs.

Rather than censoring the press, in the old communist manner, Orbán has forced the closure of hostile newspapers on trumped-up economic grounds. And he has subsequently arranged for his wealthy friends and allies to buy much of the national and local media and to turn TV channels and newspapers alike into organs of state power. This is how he has shielded from public scrutiny both his electoral manipulation and epic levels of insider corruption. By packing the courts with loyalist judges, he can also claim to have legality and constitutionality squarely on his side. The legitimacy of such a system depends less on electoral victories, therefore, than on the rulers’ claim to be defending an arbitrarily delineated ‘genuine nation’ against its inner as well as outer enemies.

Putin’s belligerent speech was like a declaration of war. It was a scathing assault on the global security architecture crafted by the Western powers. It was seeded with pungently sarcastic asides meant to violate informal norms about how non-Western supplicants seeking favours from Western governments were expected to behave in polite company. He denounced NATO expansion as an act of betrayal, citing verbatim one long-forgotten official promise that such eastward encroachment would never be allowed to happen. But his list of grievances against the West cut much deeper. He accused the United States of ‘global destabilization’ and blatant ‘disdain for international law’. America’s bid to be the world’s ‘one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making’, dictating permissible behaviour to other countries, had scandalously backfired. Washington’s ‘almost uncontained hyper use of force – military force – in international relations,’ he elaborated, ‘is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts’.

In the early 1990s, in the immediate aftermath of the communist collapse, life expectancy in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe fell precipitously. It is estimated that in Russia alone, between 1989 and 1995, there were 1.3 to 1.7 million premature deaths. Average life expectancy plummeted from 70 in 1989 to 64 in 1995. The proximate causes included a significant increase in suicides and drug and alcohol abuse, which led to an epidemic of cardiovascular and liver diseases.

By openly speaking of Russia’s tragic defeat, Putin escaped the clutches of those members of the Yeltsin clan who had engineered his accession to power and who were commonly seen as morally compromised collaborators with the West. By speaking this way, he was soon acclaimed to be the liberator of his people. What he liberated them from was liberal hypocrisy. He allowed his countrymen to stop pretending that ‘the transition’ was taking Russians to a better place. By the early 2000s, he successfully freed them from a demeaning post-1991 ‘made in America’ hierarchy of values.21 By the time of the 2014 Crimean annexation, his bare-chested bravado was widely celebrated as having firmly established Russia’s independence from the moralistic parochialism of the American-led unipolar world.

One reasonable fear was that the privileged Soviet elites would fight back, making the general population’s exit from history a bloody one. Happily, this did not happen. One reason is that Marx’s final gift to the Soviet elites was persuading them not only that capitalism was designed for the predatory self-enrichment of a few but also that Western democracy was a shrewdly constructed system for maintaining class domination. Democracy, viewed in this cynical light, had nothing to do with the accountability of politicians to citizens. On the contrary, the democratic illusion of accountability helped mask and preserve the autonomy of a political ruling class that was never, as a whole, chosen in a fairly contested multi-candidate election.

What distinguishes political consultants in the West from Russian political technologists is that the former work closely with independent media: their tradecraft involves influencing news organizations that they cannot directly control. Political technologists ply a different trade. They are experts in manipulating politically dependent media. Political consultants in the West are experts at winning votes for their candidates. Russian-style political technologists, too, are specialists at winning votes. They take an additional step, however. They also specialize in the ‘creative counting’ of votes. A political consultant works for one of the parties in an election and does his best to help that party win. The Russian political technologist is not so much interested in the victory of his party as in the victory of ‘the system’. His goal is not simply to maximize the vote count for his client, but to obtain an election result as close as possible to the electoral percentage that the Kremlin has planned in advance for a given candidate or party list.

In explaining the inspiration for his strategy, Pavlovsky likes to tell a story about an ordinary voter he interviewed during the run-up to the 1996 election. The voter reported that she supported Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party candidate, but was going to vote for Yeltsin. When he asked her why she wasn’t going to vote for Zyuganov, she replied, ‘When Zyuganov is president, I will vote for him.’39 It turns out that people often support, or at least accept, rulers not for what they do but simply because of the offices they inhabit or titles they hold. ‘Popularity’ in Russia is a consequence not a cause of the power one wields. Instead of representing people’s interests, elections register the willingness of voters to submit to incumbents who are able to sideline any and all challengers to their power.

After the politically embarrassing and stressful 2011 and 2012 elections, mimicking the West’s domestic institutions and slogans stopped being the regime’s preferred method for sheltering itself from Western influence. The Russian regime needed to go on the offensive not in order to reclaim its position as a global superpower but simply in order to survive. To that end, it even dreamed of destroying the American-created post-1989 liberal order. American support for the 2010–12 Arab Spring and especially the NATO-led military intervention in Libya confirmed the Kremlin’s darkest fears that the United States is a revolutionary power with which Putin’s Russia could not peaceably coexist. The path it chose was surprising, however. To subvert Western hegemony, Russia did not abandon but refashioned, redirected and weaponized its strategy of imitating the West.

The most dramatic recent non-Russian example of this kind of aggressive imitation is the decision by media-savvy ISIS propagandists to dress ISIS captives in orange jumpsuits before executing them.85 The gruesome pantomime represents a conscious attempt to imitate America’s humiliation of Muslim prisoners at Guantanamo. The jihadists sought to provide a mirror-image of the way America violates the basic human dignity of Muslim prisoners. They obviously believed that this cruelly scornful mimicry exposed the hollowness of the West’s claims to moral superiority.

A good example of aggressive imitation is Putin’s March 2014 speech announcing Russia’s annexation of Crimea. This official address lifted whole passages from speeches by Western leaders justifying the dismantling of Serbian territory in Kosovo and applied them to the Crimean case.87 Thus, what most Western observers took to be the first step in Putin’s attempt to restore Moscow’s empire was explicitly justified by the rhetoric of US President Woodrow Wilson extolling the fundamental right of popular self-determination.

This brings us to the allegation that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential elections in the United States, something that the Kremlin officially (if inconsistently) denies and that American intelligence officials adamantly affirm. That the United States has regularly meddled in foreign elections is well known.89 This includes at least one important Russian case: the 1996 election that returned Yeltsin to the presidency. Without help from a team of American political consultants and especially without a Clinton-arranged loan from the IMF coming on the eve of the elections, it is very likely that Boris Yeltsin would have lost his bid for re-election in 1996.

During the two decades after the Second World War, when the United States was the world’s sole industrial powerhouse, working-class America did extraordinarily well. In the two decades after the end of the Cold War, by which time the US example had inspired legions of industrial imitators abroad, these same working-class families began to struggle. In these latter years, to maintain the façade of a middle-class existence to which they had become accustomed, many Americans went on a profligate borrowing spree. Then came the financial crash of 2008. The burden of their credit-card-enabled imitation game became unsustainable and the precipitous loss of status subsequently experienced by those unable to pay their debts fuelled the anti-liberal revolt in America just as it did in Hungary. Populist demagogues exploited these conditions to convince voters whose fortunes were sinking and who saw few prospects for their children to blame a conspiracy of immigrants and multicultural elites, even though their misfortunes actually stemmed from a combination of automization and the planetary redistribution of middle-class reputability (and faith in the future) from America and Europe to India and China.

A classic treatment of the dangerous untethering of the American establishment from the bulk of the population, a disengagement which prepared the country for Trump, is Christopher Lasch’s 1995 book, The Revolt of the Elites. America’s ‘privileged classes,’ Lasch explains, ‘have made themselves independent not only of crumbling industrial cities but of public services in general’. They see private doctors, send their children to private schools, have private security guards and live in gated communities. Having ‘ceased to think of themselves as Americans in any important sense’, they are ‘deeply indifferent to the prospect of American national decline’.

In America, similarly, the populist backlash reflects a transformation of what should have been a working-class party, the Democrats, into the party of educated elites. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama seemed to be saying: Imitate us! Get a college education. Or better, a post-graduate one. To white high-school graduates who were already feeling superfluous in the new Knowledge Economy, such an Imitation Imperative felt like an existential reproach. They were in no position to imitate the urban elite and its liberal values. They weren’t going to college and were therefore naturally looking for a politician who would fight back, who would tell them they weren’t lost simply because they didn’t have a college degree, who would assure them that they didn’t have to imitate the well-educated but could just go on being themselves. For this subgroup, Trump is the President who has liberated them from a meritocratic value hierarchy that left them feeling deprived of all socially acknowledged merit.

The history of Lebanon’s Shia community is said to stretch back to the early days of Islam, the oldest community outside Medina, where, after the prophet Muhammad died, some had chosen Ali, cousin of the prophet and husband of his daughter Fatima, as the rightful heir. They were known hence as the partisans of Ali, shi’at Ali. Others believed that the prophet had named Abu Bakr, a close companion, as his successor and first caliph of the Muslim nation. The struggle opposed two visions for the succession: one religious, through a line of the prophet’s descendants known as imams (leaders of prayer); and the other, more earthly, centered on power, caliphs (literally, “successors”), chosen by consensus among wise men.

The story that would be most widely told in the decades to come about the birth of Hezbollah is that it was born from the ashes of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. After rose petals came bullets, and then car bombs. The story is not entirely wrong. Without the Israeli invasion and occupation, Hezbollah may not have been able to take root in the country. But this is not the whole story. Sheikh Tufayli’s eureka moment at the Damascus airport preceded the rage of occupation. Even before 1979, Khomeini’s disciples had identified Lebanon as fertile terrain for their revolutionary projects.

Zia had caused worldwide consternation when he had Bhutto hanged. He drew rebukes from the West over the abuse of human rights in his first years in power. But once the war against the Soviets began, none of it mattered anymore. Zia was now an essential partner to America and money flowed into the country—official aid from the West and covert assistance from the Gulf funded the Afghan mujahedeen. The survival of Zia’s regime was ensured, its longevity a sin helped by the outside world—a sin that Pakistanis would struggle to forgive, especially its women. Mehtab had perhaps been right—Zia would not have lasted in feisty, boisterous Pakistan had it not been for the geopolitics that dictated his survival.

In 1987 Palestinians had rebelled in the West Bank and Gaza, after twenty years of life under Israeli occupation, arbitrary detentions, and land expropriations. Neither freedom nor peace was in sight. The First Palestinian Intifada (uprising) was a grassroots popular movement with mass protests that lasted six years but resolved nothing. Peace talks that began in 1991 in Madrid and then Oslo brought only slow, barely tangible progress. And so, just a few months ahead of Zawahiri and the attack on Alfi, Palestinian militants had opted to try suicide bombings in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, targeting a restaurant in the Jewish settlement of Mehola. That attack made few headlines. But Palestinians would continue to carry out countless suicide bombings against Israelis, both civilians and soldiers, in the Occupied Territories and inside Israel. Beyond fighting occupation, Zawahiri’s endorsement of suicide bombings had opened a treacherous door. In less than a decade, Zawahiri and Bin Laden would send nineteen hijackers on a suicide mission to crash their planes into buildings in the United States.

From far-flung villages or cities, store clerks, police, and army officers met in prison and expanded the network of Salafists. In October 2002, as the drums of war were beating, Saddam emptied his jails. This was a trick in the well-worn dictator playbook: preemptive sabotage.

The blasphemy law had initially been codified by the British a century earlier, in what was then pre-partition India. The intention had been to punish insults against any religious beliefs in an effort to preserve harmony between the different sects in the British colonial empire: Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and other. While in power, Zia added teeth to the laws, severely criminalizing any perceived insult to the prophet, his companions, the Quran, and basically anything having to do with Islam. In 1986, blasphemy against the prophet became punishable by death or imprisonment for life. Finally, in October 1990, the Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan called on the government to amend the penalty for blasphemy, making death the only punishment possible.

Perhaps the worst leftover from the Zia era was the sectarian intolerance and violence, both of which had grown exponentially since those first killings in the Kurram district in 1987. It continued with a massacre of 150 Shias by Sunni vigilantes in 1988, followed by retaliatory assassinations of militant Shia leaders. In 1996, there were five days of Sunni-Shia fighting in Parachinar that left two hundred dead. Mosques were being bombed, both Sunni and Shia.

Just over a year after the fall of Mubarak, in the summer of 2012, Mohammad Morsi, an engineering professor with a PhD from the University of Southern California, was elected president of Egypt. Where the United States saw free and fair elections, the Saudis saw a vital threat, for two reasons. Morsi was a lifelong member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which meant Islamists had arrived at the top, not with a coup, not with an assassination, not with an uprising, but through the ballot box; a successful example of political Islam could feed calls for elections in Saudi Arabia itself. The Saudis were also deeply distrustful of the Muslim Brotherhood generally, since the betrayal of the political sahwa of the 1990s.

On August 21, 2013, Yassin almost lost Samira forever. The Syrian regime forces had launched an attack with chemical weapons against Eastern Ghouta, the opposition-held area outside Damascus that included Douma. Up to fourteen hundred people died. The sight of children gasping, foaming at the mouth, and whole families killed in their sleep galvanized world opinion again—two years into the rebellion. But only briefly. President Obama had previously warned Assad that the use of chemical attacks was a redline. Missile strikes against Damascus seemed imminent for days, until Washington and Moscow made a deal under which Assad would give up his chemical weapons. America did not want to go to war and Assad survived.

The toll on civilians was shocking: hostages of ISIS in their own city for four years, they would die in air strikes meant to liberate them. Whole families were wiped out in an instant; sixteen hundred civilians were killed during months of shelling. But by October 2017, America could claim victory against ISIS.

People in Europe or the United States often ask blithely, where are the Muslims and Arabs speaking out against extremism and terrorism? It is deeply troubling to expect that all Muslims should apologize or take responsibility for a minuscule fraction of those who share their faith. Furthermore, the question ignores the devastating sacrifices of those who have been fighting intolerance and its violent manifestations within their own countries long before anyone in the West even thought to pose the question. Far too many progressive minds in the wider Middle East have been left to fend for themselves for decades, as they and their countries were bludgeoned to death by forces of darkness, forces, such as Zia in Pakistan, that most often served Western interests. The largest number of victims of jihadist violence are Muslims themselves within their own countries.

From invasions to coups and support for dictators, America’s actions have fed and aggravated local dynamics.

Trade unions established in the early to mid-twentieth century, operating through the institutional frameworks of governments, have held a monopoly over labor history. They had no interest in promoting workers’ autonomous struggles, since the mere existence of those struggles called into question the traditional union structures and roles. In addition, most left, Socialist, and Communist parties did not promote workers’ control either, since it challenged the centrality of the role of the parties.

What workers’ control points to is more than just a new way of organizing production; it is also the release of human creative energy on a vast scale. As such it is inherently revolutionary. But at the same time, because of the very weight of what it must overcome, it appears correspondingly remote from day-to-day struggles. As a political rallying point, it has two specific drawbacks. First, its urgency in many situations is not likely to be as great as that of survival demands; second, its full application will remain limited as long as there are economic forces beyond the reach of the workers—whether within a given country or outside it (Dallemagne 1976, 114).

Despite the unprecedented surge of factory takeovers that occurred throughout 1917, the Bolshevik leadership looked upon such actions as at most an expression of revolt against the bourgeoisie. It did not treat them as a form to build upon in the course of a transition to socialism. Instead, going along with the emphasis on obedience, Lenin repeatedly urged a prominent managerial role for former capitalists. When the Bolsheviks adopted the slogan of “workers’ control,” therefore, they made clear that they understood “control” in the limited European sense of “checking” (Brinton 1970, 12).

What was at issue, in effect, was an entire approach to the transitional process. The acceptance of Taylorist methods was just one component—albeit a central one—of Lenin’s larger view of the Russian economy as still requiring full development of the capitalist production process even if under (presumed) working-class leadership. Lenin referred to this contradictory stage as “state capitalism,” which he saw as a necessary prerequisite to socialism (Lenin 1971b, 440).

Two things are certain, however.

The circumstances in question all relate to Russia’s position as pacesetter. First, as already suggested, the period itself was one in which the impressiveness of capitalism’s productive attainments was still largely unquestioned. Second, the very economic backwardness that made Russian society so explosive also required that any revolutionary government place a premium upon growth. Third, the workers themselves operated under a series of specific disadvantages, the most decisive of which was the lack of sufficient tradition and organization to enable them to coordinate their self-management initiatives. And finally, in response to the civil war (an externally supported counterrevolution), huge numbers of the most dedicated workers—two hundred thousand by April 1918 from Moscow alone—departed for the front (Murphy 2005, 65f ). For any who may have returned, the moment of their potential collective strength was lost.

The Politics of Revolutionary Workers’ Control: Three Cases The Russian experience, although the first of its kind, was also the one in which the anticapitalist struggle came closest to success. We have seen, though, how distant it still was from a genuine victory. The capitalists were politically and militarily defeated, but their conception of workplace hierarchy survived. The subsequent trajectories of Italy, Spain, and Chile demonstrate almost the exact opposite dynamic. The capitalist class in all three cases recovered its position in the most thoroughgoing and brutal form possible, via fascism. But the workers in each case made unprecedented advances which, taken together, go far toward mapping the place of workers’ control in current and future revolutions.

The real catalyst, however, was provided by the reactionary forces. This reflected another unique aspect of the Spanish case. In Italy, as in Germany, fascism had intervened only after the high tide of the workers’ movement had already passed—outlasted in the former case by a relatively unified bourgeoisie, crushed in the latter by an unholy alliance of Social Democrats and generals. In Spain of the 1930s, the bourgeoisie was still something of a rising class.

A key moment had occurred in Barcelona on July 21, 1936. The armed workers, having routed the bourgeoisie, were offered power by the Catalan president. They declined. As explained by one of their anarchist leaders: “We could have remained alone, imposed our absolute will, declared the [Catalan state] null and void, and imposed the true power of the people in its place, but we did not believe in dictatorship when it was being exercised against us, and we did not want it when we could exercise it ourselves only at the expense of others” (ibid., 131).

For while the anarchists backed the workers but refused to accept their mandate, the Communists welcomed a role in the government but used it—with even greater insistence than their bourgeois partners—to undo the revolutionary gains of the workers (Thomas 1961, 436). Santiago Carrillo’s later “Eurocommunist” position had its roots at the beginning of his career; already in January 1937 he was saying, as secretary-general of the Socialist-Communist Youth, “We are not Marxist youth. We fight for a democratic, parliamentary republic” (ibid., 366). The practical meaning of such statements was revealed after May 1937, when the Republican government (with Communist participation) began the systematic restoration of private ownership in agriculture and industry. 11 This was almost two years before the final victory of fascism.

The argument for suppressing workers’ control was found not in any failures of the workers themselves but rather in the international situation—a factor that became critical when Nazi and Italian Fascist forces intervened on Franco’s side. The Soviet Union was the only outside power willing to aid the republic, but Stalin did not wish to jeopardize his defensive alliance with France by supporting revolution in Spain. More generally, the Communist parties argued that the only hope of additional support against Franco would come from portraying the battle strictly as one of “democracy versus fascism.”

The development of worker-control institutions in Cuba has been continuous. Its underpinnings can be seen in the mass-participation practices—militias, voluntary labor, and the literacy campaign—that marked the early years of the revolution (Fuller 1992, 187–91). By the mid-1980s, “baselevel input into planning” was routine among production workers (ibid., 116). And in the wider institutional debate that has been taking place since 2002, the goal of deepened participation in every sphere of public life has taken center stage (Duharte 2010). In the process, there is a continuous push toward decentralization of power and, at the theoretical level, a sense that the relationship of reform to revolution is, over the long term, not one of antagonism, but rather one of mutual reinforcement (Hernández 2010).

It is hard to conceive the launch of Venezuela’s “twenty-first-century socialism” in the absence of Cuban solidarity. The massive presence in Venezuela of Cuban healthcare workers and teachers was a core component of the gains that could be credited to the Chávez government in its early years. This form of aid is unique in that it does not stem from any great economic or military power. Cubans in Venezuela—unlike Soviets in Cuba in the 1960s and ’70s—are not trying to shape their host country’s development strategy. They are not guides, but participants. Not only have they come by the thousands, but they also work directly in the popular neighborhoods (rather than as technical advisers). Their presence in the country reflects a relationship of equals. Although the power-transfer phases of the Cuban and Venezuelan revolutions had little in common, in both cases the popular protagonists became imbued with a culture of commitment and, hence, of participation.

Until the outbreak of war on August 4, 1914, socialist parties across Europe had denounced imperialist war and promised “to intervene for its speedy termination” (1907 resolution of the Second International, quoted in Frölich 1972, 168–9). Within days of the outbreak most had abandoned their pledge and lined up with their respective state machines. On August 2 the British Labour Party held a demonstration on the theme “Down with War!” (McNair 1955, 43–4). A few months later it entered the wartime coalition government and supported the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) and the Munitions Act outlawing strikes. All but one of Germany’s mighty Social Democratic Party (SPD) deputies voted to back the war, and the Kaiser declared a “state of siege.”

Munitions workers, the key industrial force for modern warfare, were a particular target for the state. In Britain the Munitions Act restricted the right to strike, and this was copied by Germany in its Auxiliary Service Law. Stoppages were already outlawed in Russia, while many of Italy’s workers were conscripts who faced courts-martial if they struck. Hours in the munitions industries rose to the physical limit. Fiat workers had a seventyfive-hour week, while turners in Berlin worked a standard six-day week with compulsory Sunday working of five to twelve hours (ibid., 52). Trade union officials, following their reformist political counterparts, did nothing to oppose this.

On the other side the ruling class and their ally in the SPD were impatiently anticipating a counterattack. They feared the increasing self-confidence of workers who, as one example, rejected a generous pay deal on the grounds that “in a socialist state there is no longer any room for negotiations with private capitalists”(Freiheit 1918). In early January 1919 the government sacked Emil Eichhorn, Berlin’s left-wing police chief, knowing that this would provoke the revolutionaries into action in Berlin. This posed a dilemma for the revolutionary left, which, though growing fast, still did not command a majority in the Arbeiterräte. Should they first win over the councils to the idea of challenging for state power, or should they bypass them and act immediately? A section of the Obleute and the newly formed German Communist Party (KPD) decided to follow the latter path. The result—the so-called Spartacist rising—was a disaster.

This body had already been established in St. Petersburg in 1905, when defeat in the war against Japan triggered a revolution. Leon Trotsky, chair of the Petersburg Soviet, summed up its strengths in this way. It was a response to an objective need—a need born of the course of events. It was an organisation which was authoritative and yet had no traditions, which could immediately involve a scattered mass of hundreds of thousands of people while having virtually no organisational machinery; which united the revolutionary currents within the proletariat; which was capable of initiative and spontaneous self-control—and most important of all, which could be brought out from underground within twenty-four hours (Trotsky 1971, 122).

the Bolsheviks, who argued for “All power to the soviets,” could muster only 65 deputies out of 2,800. However, the successive political crises of April, July, and September reflected a constant, democratic evolution in the soviet’s political complexion. As the continuing war and deepening social collapse took their toll, so did the soviet march in step with workers’ radicalization. In April 1917 Vladimir Lenin had argued that the Bolshevik Party he led must “struggle for influence within the Soviets . . .” (Lenin 1964, 49), and as time passed this approach paid off. Instant recall meant that popular disappointment with Menshevik and Social Revolutionary government policy led to their delegates being progressively withdrawn, with revolutionaries taking their places. By October 1917 the Bolsheviks had a majority in the Petrograd council, and in an almost bloodless insurrection the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet took power, seizing control of the Winter Palace and toppling the Kerensky government with a minimum of casualties. The revolutionary committee then declared that the soviet system would form the basis of the new socialist state.

The developments of World War II reinforced, in a negative sense, the hardwon lessons of the Paris Commune and World War I. In the earlier cases workers’ councils could not succeed when they lacked the self-consciousness and revolutionary purpose that could only be injected into them by a radical socialist party.

The lesson of the European experience has been that workers’ councils are the basis for a different kind of state. Through instant recall, and the fact that shop-floor delegates receive no special pay while being directly and immediately responsible to their electors, they offer a kind of democracy undreamt of by any conventional institution. As the collective expression of the working class they provide a means of overcoming the sham democracy of parliamentary elections under capitalism. In capitalism real power is held by the bosses, not the disparate mass of individuals grouped together by an accident of geography, who do little more than put an “x” on a sheet of paper before abandoning the field to power and privilege for the next several years.

However, the formation of workers’ councils cannot be undertaken in isolation, but only in a symbiotic relationship with organized radical ideas. Without a self-conscious understanding of the revolutionary potential of the council, its very strength—grassroots democracy—will tend to reflect reformism and stay within the bounds of capitalist society. Equally, without workers’ self-organization and democracy—without the workers’ council—there can be no socialism.

“This purely class-founded, proletarian organization was the organization of the revolution as such.” Describing the soviet, Trotsky refers directly to the production-based logic of the workers’ council structure: “Since the production process was the sole link between the proletarian masses . . . representation had to be adapted to the factories and plants . . . . One delegate was elected for every 500 workers . . . [although] in some cases delegates represented only a hundred . . . workers, or even fewer” (Trotsky 1971, 104).

Izvestiya, the soviets’ daily, still controlled by the moderate Socialists, described the conflict as characteristic of a whole series of cases of announced closures that were reaching the Central Council of factory committees. Most often the owners cited financial losses and a lack of funds. “But at the first attempt of the workers’ organizations to verify the reasons . . . , they very often uncover the most complex and crafty machinations aimed at a lockout” (Izvestiya, June 17, 1917). Nor was this phenomenon limited to the capital. In the textile center of Ivanovo-Voznesensk, when several mills failed to reopen after the Easter holiday, with the owners claiming supply problems, the local soviet announced that idled workers were to receive full wages and that it was setting up a control commission. The mills reopened immediately (Utro Rossii, April 27, 1917).

Sensing the shift, the industrialists became more aggressive.

These examples argue against the “anarchist” interpretation of workers’ control. It is true that the Central Council’s guidelines for regional sovnarkhozy initially called for their election solely by the factory committees, a syndicalist position. However, the council did not oppose the Supreme Sovnarkhoz’s proposal to include representatives from the soviets, cooperatives, and technical-managerial personnel (FZK, 3:437–79).

But a March decree of the Supreme Sovnarkhoz fell far short of the committees’ position. It called for the directorate of each industrial branch (glavky) to appoint a commissar to each factory under its supervision, as well as technical and administrative directors. The technical director could be overruled only by the commissar or by the branch directorate. The administrative director, on the other hand, would work under the supervision of an economic administrative council, consisting of representatives of the workers, white-collar and technical staff, the trade union, and the local soviet. But workers and white-collar employees would constitute no more than half of its members. As for the factory committees, they could not issue orders but had to go through the economic administrative councils (Carr 1966, 92). The emphasis on centralism at the expense of meaningful worker participation in management would grow stronger with the outbreak of full-scale civil war and the deepening economic crisis that forced the Soviet state into a desperate survival mode for the next several years. These conditions strengthened the hand of supporters of authoritarian management, with people like Lenin and Trotsky, formerly on the left, rallying to their side. (The Mensheviks continued to limit themselves to demanding trade union autonomy.) Within the Bolshevik Party the cause of the factory committees was taken up by the Left Opposition and, later by the Workers’ Opposition, the latter unsuccessfully defending a syndicalist position.

The factory councils were the outcome of a high point of widespread militancy, independent local action, and confrontation that erupted immediately after World War I among industrial workers in Turin and in the rest of Italy.

The relationship between factory councils and trade unions and the question of the voting rights of nonunionized employees were closely linked. The resulting debate illustrated contrasting conceptions of workers’ organizations not only in industrial and political relations, but also in the development of a revolutionary movement. As the anarchist Garino reflected: As regards the relationships with union organizations, three ideas were supported. The first wanted the councils to be inside the unions, in such a way as to cancel out their autonomy. The second, supported by Antonio Gramsci and the socialists of L’Ordine Nuovo, was opposed to this assimilation and considered the councils as revolutionary bodies preparing to take political power. And finally, the third, defended by us, the anarchists, saw the councils as revolutionary bodies outside the unions, capable not of assuming power, but of destroying it (Lattarulo and Ambrosoli 1971/2009).

That can’t happen, the party will not allow one man to take the reins of power and do whatever he likes.” “I’m not convinced,” I said, “and I’ll tell you what I believe: when you take power, we’ll be the first to be shot.” Gramsci jumped to his feet, with that big bushy head: “Garino, Garino, no!

The failure highlighted the unresolved contradictions of the relationship between factory councils and national union organizations. Despite Gramsci’s attempt to keep the two bodies separate, it was clear that for much of the movement factory councils stood in opposition to the reformist trade unions. At the national congress of FIOM in May 1920, the factory council experiment was an object of bitter criticism and attacks by most union officials (Antonioli and Bezza 1978, 571–72). The question of the relationship between this form of workers’ representation and the unions also led to the debate between Gramsci and Tasca in the spring of 1920 (Spriano 1971, 89–92). At the congress of Turin’s Chamber of Labour at the end of May 1920, Tasca proposed a motion that reestablished the union leaders’ position locally: internal commissions would continue to exist, but without the capacity to decide policy; local union representatives would not be elected by the workshop commissars. Political decisions would rest with the union leadership. Tasca’s motion “proved acceptable to local union leaders and won easily” (Levy 1999, 163).

Barcelona, the epicenter of the revolution, saw what Chris Ealham has described as the “biggest revolutionary fiesta in twentieth-century Europe.” Workers’ control extended to the expropriation of property and its reallocation for social needs. In some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods there was an existing prewar culture of resistance and occupation of urban space, and this provided the basis for an embryonic process of social transformation. Not only did parties and unions occupy premises on a massive scale, but churches, the houses of the wealthy, and other buildings were also transformed into hospitals, schools, popular restaurants, warehouses, and garages (2005, 113, 122–127).

The (CNT) defense committees, transformed into revolutionary neighborhood committees, in the absence of any slogan from any organization and without any more coordination than the revolutionary initiatives that each moment demanded, organized hospitals (and) popular dining halls, confiscated cars, lorries, arms, factories and buildings, searched private homes and carried out arrests of suspicious individuals and created a network of Supply Committees (Guillamón 2007, 80).

A majority of collectives made moves toward reducing wage differentials. Medical services were established, as were pension schemes. Nurseries were sometimes organized, reflecting the integration of women into industry. Training and education were also promoted and work was occasionally given to those previously involved in “pernicious activities,” such as “prostitutes, gamblers and boxers” (Castells 2002, 136).

Despite all these obstacles many urban collectives proved surprisingly efficient, especially when grouped together in associations. In addition to generally improving working conditions, they introduced administrative and structural reforms: for instance, accountancy was centralized, which facilitated bookkeeping and statistics. There was also a drastic reduction of intermediaries: producers and consumers were in closer contact. Developmental research was encouraged, as was import substitution to overcome the war’s disruption of trade. In some cases, the industrial plant and stock were in a better condition when they were returned to the owners at the end of the war than when they had been taken over.

Agrarian collectives were usually run by an elected committee and brought under common use fundamentals such as fertilizers, seeds, and machinery. In many, artisans and traders also participated. Frequently schools and cultural centers were established and literacy campaigns launched. Most collectives did not confine themselves to economic issues but often took responsibility for the economic, social, and political life of the village as a whole.

Collectivization had also been previously carried out in Castile. When the civil war began the practice spread throughout the region. Initially spontaneous, the collectivization process was soon taken over by the unions, especially the predominant UGT. The CNT, in contrast, hardly existed in Castile at the beginning of the war but grew from three thousand to one hundred thousand members during the first ten months of the war, especially among smallholders. Eventually the anarcho-syndicalists ran 186 of the 455 collectives in the region. According to César Lorenzo, “collectives were . . . so general and spontaneous” in Andalucía and Castile “that no one dared to argue against them.” As a result even members of the PCE and the Republican parties were sometimes involved (Rodrigo González 1985; Lorenzo 1969, 160).

It was in Aragon that the most radical experiments in collectivization took place, reflecting both the poverty of most villages and the fact that in this region the state had collapsed altogether. Hence in many localities a system of vouchers often replaced money. This was not primarily for ideological reasons, as has often been assumed, but because the absence of the state and the subsistence nature of the local economy made the use of currency unnecessary. Goods and food were distributed on the basis of villagers’ needs.

Established in late September, the new Catalan government, like the CCMA before it, had a Popular Front majority but the CNT maintained, at least for the time being, a powerful influence.76 The most important initiative taken by the Generalitat Council was the introduction of a collectivization decree, which sanctioned and systematized the process under way since July. Under the decree management councils were set up in each company, unions being represented proportionally along with a representative named by the Generalitat. The decree represented a compromise among the different factions in the government. It put an end to spontaneous collectivization and opened the way to increasing state intervention in the economy. Other measures introduced by the new Catalan government included the expansion and municipalization of public services, a system of people’s tribunals to try suspected supporters of the rebels, legislation regulating civil marriage, a very liberal divorce law, access to birth control, legalized abortion, the promotion of progressive methods in education, and an ambitious program of school building.

Moves by the Republican authorities to gain control in the economic sphere were accompanied by measures to create a state monopoly over security. By spring 1937, violent clashes in Catalonia between rival factions and between the police and radicalized workers had become increasingly frequent. Continual accusations in the Communist press that the POUM and other “uncontrollables” were “fascist agents” provided further justification for attacks on the extreme left.

The underlying tension between those that advocated continuing with the revolution and those that saw it as an impediment to winning the war was most dramatically reflected in the campaign by the PSUC and the Soviet government against the dissident Communist POUM. The campaign against “Trotskyism” was now exported beyond the borders of the USSR. The PSUC and PCE, like Communist parties elsewhere at the time, were completely subordinate to Moscow and soon launched a massive campaign of slander against the “Trotskyist-Fascist” POUM. Inevitably, given the strength of both the revolution and the POUM in the region, this campaign centered on Catalonia.

Attempts to reassert Republican authority solely by administrative means and propaganda were not sufficient. Apart from the POUM, many anarcho-syndicalists still believed that they were fighting not to defend the Republic but to advance the social revolution. This unsustainable situation came to a head on May 3, when Republican Assault Guards tried to seize the Barcelona telephone exchange, a symbol of workers’ control in the city. The resultant street fighting proved a watershed for the revolution. Resistance was organized by the CNT defense committees, rooted in the poorer neighborhoods, and the radical anarchist group, the Friends of Durruti.79 The latter stood apart from other anarchist groupings, having called for the creation of revolutionary juntas based on the CNT, FAI, and POUM that should “take power.”

The CNT and FAI leaderships, nevertheless, balked at a POUM proposal to completely take over Barcelona, fearing such an initiative might further aggravate the situation. Calls by the libertarian leaders for a ceasefire led to both the dismantling of the barricades and the deepening of opposition inside the CNT to collaboration with the Popular Front parties.

Earlier, in October 1936, the Agricultural Ministry, in Communist hands, had introduced a decree that allowed for the return of land to former owners, obliged the revision of expropriations carried out by unions, and ensured that peasants could choose between individual or collective exploitation of land. Attempts at enforcing the decree led to increasing tension between the collectivists—who generally refused to observe its regulations—and their opponents. This was particularly the case in Valencia, where the PCE organized conservative peasants into the Federación Provincial Campesino (FPC). Aided by the police, the FPC used the decree to arrest collectivists and destroy property. By January 1938 the Valencian CNT could report that the “counter revolution was active in every village” (Casanova 1988 38–9).

Decentralization of state power on the macro level and the abolition of hierarchical organization inside the single enterprises were identified as two main measures for preventing the Soviet mistakes and reviving the process of the “withering away of the state,” as had been envisioned by Marxists prior to Stalinist revisionism.

The global recession of the late 1970s hit Yugoslavia harder than any other socialist country; the increasing prices of raw materials, spare parts, and components—all needed for the exporting industries—resulted in the increase of production costs and loss of competitiveness. In addition, the interest on loans was rising steeply and, by 1981, the Yugoslav government found itself on the edge of bankruptcy with over $20 billion in foreign debt (Sörensen 2009, 77). The prolonged economic crisis gave rise to the feeling that further reforms were necessary. Once the source of great pride, the system of self-management was no longer regarded as a unique, worthy pursuit but viewed increasingly by government officials as an obstacle to further modernization.

The mounting popular discontent gradually spilled over into the ruling party. Lower-rank officials and local state enterprise managers attempted to join forces with various protest groups inside the republics. The tipping point was reached in the autumn of 1988, when the Serbian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, under the leadership of Slobodan Milošević, openly broke with the unified line of the federal government against the street protests and extended political support to handpicked demonstrations. By reinterpreting the hitherto dominant notion of the dichotomy between the “exploiter and exploited” in nationalist terms, this group of the Serbian political elite organized a wave of rallies in Serbia and the surrounding republics, co-opting the movement previously based on class issues. These top-down, nationalist mobilizations, which came to be known as the “antibureaucratic revolution,” opened the door for the violent disintegration of the country.

The widespread practice by workers, begun in the wake of liberation, of taking over abandoned enterprises and reopening them under the direction of ad hoc “works councils” (rada zakladowa), garnered the support of the new state power in gestation. Still very weak, the new state had no choice but to count on the organizational and productive initiative of the workers as a decisive factor in the industrial and economic reconstruction of the country. Nonetheless, for numerous Communist and left-wing Socialist cadres, this was not a pragmatic but rather a programmatic issue: they wanted all industrial power to be handed over not just to the new state, but to the working class itself.

Still very weak, the new state had no choice but to count on the organizational and productive initiative of the workers as a decisive factor in the industrial and economic reconstruction of the country. Nonetheless, for numerous Communist and left-wing Socialist cadres, this was not a pragmatic but rather a programmatic issue: they wanted all industrial power to be handed over not just to the new state, but to the working class itself. However, the February 1945 government decree on works councils barely gave them limited rights to participate in the management of enterprises. When the decree came into force in May, eleven days later it was annulled by an instruction from the Ministry of Industry enforcing the full and exclusive singular power of the chief manager over an enterprise. This illicit act represented a huge blow by the bureaucracy that was quickly consolidating itself inside the economic state apparatus. The works councils, deprived not only of any capacity to manage the enterprises but also of any right to comanagement, were incorporated into the labor unions, which were soon transformed into “transmission belts” for the governing party and, in fact, for the state apparatus (Golebiowski 1961; Kowalewski 2007). The defeat of this first self-management movement of the working class was soon followed by strike movements against food shortages, low wages, the rise of production quotas, and the lengthening of the workday (Kaminski 1999).

In June 1956, the city of Poznan witnessed Poland’s first use of the mass inter-enterprise strike combined with street demonstrations. One hundred thousand workers held a rally in the public square. There were also attempts at armed insurrection by the new working-class elements, but they were not supported by the older class. The bureaucracy responded with the occupation of the city by ten thousand troops and three hundred sixty tanks. There were fifty-eight deaths. However, the onset of a serious political crisis of the bureaucratic regime prevented even those who took up arms from being condemned to prison (Jastrzab 2006).

The main objective of these workers’ councils was to establish self-management as the basis for workers’ and socialist democracy. A general point of reference was the Yugoslav “self-management socialism.” For the radical left—the so-called October left—that headed the movement, the key issue to be resolved was: who should control the means of production, the bureaucracy or the working class?

The Law on Workers’ Councils, which was passed in the Diet (parliament) in November 1956 under pressure from the October left and the working-class movement, established that “the workers’ council manages the enterprise in the name of all the workforce.” Many other articles of the same law limited its reach when not overtly contradicting it; regardless, its passage was a great victory. However, the new leadership of the PZPR, headed by Wladyslaw Gomulka, prevented any coordination of the workers’ councils or the establishment of a Workers’ Diet or a Chamber of Self-Management that could take over the democratic management and planning of the national economy. Gomulka also repressed a strike by streetcar workers in Lodz and shut down the weekly Po Prostu, the organ of the October left, when it was about to launch the slogan “All power to the workers’ councils” (Lopienska and Szymanska 1986).

In March 1968, the political group headed by Kuron and Modzelewski unleashed a student rebellion for socialist democracy at the University of Warsaw that spread to all the universities in the country. It was the only mass movement in People’s Poland that did not arise within the working class (Eisler 2006; Oseka 2008; Kowalewski 2008a; Friszke 2010, 472–883). Although the student movement called for their support, the workers remained largely quiet until their own uprising in December 1970. As a protest against rising prices of consumer basics—increases of between 16 and 31 percent—mass strikes combined with demonstrations and street fighting were detonated in the industrial cities of the Baltic Coast, mainly in Gdansk and Szczecin. The police and the army intervened and killed forty-four people.

In Gdynia, where the uprising was better organized and articulated by workers than in neighboring Gdansk, the municipal authorities were forced to reach an agreement with the city strike committee and essentially handed over the local government.

On a purely democratic basis, the revived opposition formed the Workers’ Defense Committee (KOR).

This was the proverbial “spark that ignites the prairie fire.” It incited a huge wave of strikes in July in Lublin and in August in Gdansk and Szczecin.

The day before the inauguration of the second session of the union congress, the Diet passed the laws under dispute, in order to place before Solidarity a fait accompli. The second round began in a storm: many of the delegates denounced the agreement reached by Walesa, subjecting him to relentless criticism that undermined his leadership—which, until then, had been unquestioned. The legislative action was considered a declaration of war. In response, by a great majority of votes, the Solidarity congress adopted a new resolution proposed by the radical sectors. It declared that the union would unconditionally support the struggle for true workers’ self-management, according to the will and aspirations of the workers. It also proposed to organize of its own accord a national referendum, so that the workers could democratically choose between the laws enacted by the Diet and the project supported by Solidarity.

As Marx would have put it, “by deed instead of by argument” the struggles for workers’ self-management in Poland “have shown that production on a large scale, and in accord with the behests of modern science, may be carried on without the existence of a class of masters employing a class of hands,” and that, for a time, “in broad daylight the political economy of the middle class succumbed to the political economy of the working class” (Marx 1985, 10–11; cf. Lebowitz 2003).

In Botswana, the postcolonial state leaders were quick to restructure and take control of the labor movement, declaring that “the trade unions should develop a role which meets the needs of the country and should not adopt . . . an imported trade union philosophy with its folk history and perceptions built up over years of strife in Europe” (Mogalakwe 1997, 77). This illustrates that most nationalist leaders in Asia and Africa, in order to serve their political purposes, were motivated to neutralize the labor movement upon capturing the political space in their newly independent states. To varying degrees, under the rhetoric of rejecting class conflict as a “European” or “Western” perspective, they have succeeded in subordinating the labor movement to the postcolonial state.

In the case of the railway workers, the stations had become their centers of organizational activity directly after being seized from the Japanese authorities. Not only were the working conditions at the stations substandard, but also the workers were not receiving their regular wages to be able to provide for their basic daily needs. In the meantime the workers came to a common understanding that by performing their usual duties, they as a group were accountable and, as such, earned a sort of collective entitlement—they were aware it was informal and provisional in nature—to maintain the railway operation.95 A similar situation also occurred in the case of the plantation workers, as witnessed by Selo Soemardjan: The director and the board, not knowing to whom they owed responsibility, communicated every important decision to their fellow workers by written announcement upon the communication boards.

Before discussing the developments in the workers’ councils, it is important to mention some of the forces that had been active in the workers’ movement. The PCP (Portuguese Communist Party) had a respected tradition of opposition to fascism, and by April 25, 1974, the party had developed a cadre of perhaps five thousand members, with a substantial base and some influence in the working class. As a partner in the provisional government, the PCP immediately played its main card, that of influence over the workers’ movement. It distanced itself from the wildcat strikes and the accompanying workers’ commissions (over which it had little influence), and within a fortnight it was organizing a demonstration against strikes, accusing the workers’ commissions of being “ultra-left,” of “playing the game of the right” and of being “lackeys of the bosses.”

They went around with lists of those to be supported, nudging people which way to vote.

It is worth noting that the strike against Auto-Lite, launched by workers who were members of AFL Federal Union 18384 (an unaffiliated labor union), benefited from the active participation of unemployed workers organized by the Trotskyist-inspired Socialist Party and the National Unemployed League, led by A.

However, by the late 1940s, the UE had fallen victim to the Red Scare and perception of Communist Party influence. By 1949, the UE was forced out of the CIO and replaced by the rival International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE), a union not rooted in worker democracy (ibid., 225–238).

By the 1980s, collective bargaining had shifted its pattern to bargaining for mediocre wage gains based on extraction of productivity gains (LaBotz 1991, 117). The preceding decade’s economic recessions and capitalist restructuring had augured a new era of bargaining through surrendering to employer demands for wage cuts, harsh work rules, speedup, and tiered workforces. If unions refused to concede at the bargaining table, corporations threatened to relocate production to low-wage regions with poor working conditions.

In response, a growing number of workers vulnerable to layoffs across North America and Europe, both within and outside of unions, have resisted closures through sit-down strikes and other forms of direct action. Where unions are unwilling to resist the corporate assault on labor, militant workers are engaging in direct action through factory occupations and mass insurrections demanding that plants be reopened or layoff benefits improved.

Republic blamed the economic crisis and the end of the housing bubble for sales that had dropped from $4 million a month to $2.9 million. In addition, workers were informed that Bank of America had withdrawn a line of credit essential to keeping the company open.

Worker direct action, which has manifested in U.S. history through sit-down strikes and factory occupations, is opposed by both capital and labor union representatives. Entrenched traditional trade unions oppose workers’ control or self-activity that transfers power from union headquarters to the workplace. To ensure orderly relations, union leaders require hierarchical control and organizational loyalty rather than worker solidarity within the workplace and among workplaces. Most established unions appear to many workers as obsolete—ill-prepared for challenging corporate autocratic hegemony, with a sluggish, bureaucratic leadership and a structure antithetical to many workers’ interests. The concept of workers’ control as envisioned by the workers themselves is now being co-opted by management to suggest, outlandishly and subversively, that corporations themselves can be embodiments of freedom:

On December 2, 1977, the final rupture came between the unions and some of the factory vanguards attached to the remnants of the more moderate New Left groups on one side, and the assemblies on the other. A major national demonstration had been called in Rome by the FLM (Federazione dei Lavoratori Metalmecanici), the federation of metalworkers and historically the most militant union, in a final attempt to unite factory workers and the movements against the government’s austerity policies. The Milanese “workers’ left,” particularly the autonomous workers of Alfa Romeo, proposed a national meeting on the same day to relaunch the now flagging 1977 Movement and the assemblies. However, the movements were profoundly divided as to whether to participate in the FLM’s march or express their repudiation of the unions’ collaboration with restructuring through a separate autonomous march. On the day of the march, in an atmosphere of severe tension with thousands of heavily armed police on the streets, the FLM’s stewards prevented any split from the march to the two separate autonomist meetings at the University of Rome, which thus failed to aggregate sufficient forces to make either a success. Meanwhile, two hundred thousand trade unionists marched through Rome, accentuating their strength in contrast to the weakness and isolation of both the autonomous workers’ movement and the remnants of the 1977 Movement.

The hostile behavior of the industrialists and the judiciary toward the Kanoria workers’ militant struggle was to be expected. The CPI(M)–led Left Front government also displayed a hostile attitude toward the movement. One reason for this behavior is that the Kanoria workers supported a militant union and deserted all recognized trade unions, including those affiliated with the national CITU. Moreover, the West Bengal government concurrently developed “friendliness” agreements with private business leaders and multinationals to invite “capital.” Clearly, while the workers were seeking to advance a more militant labor movement, the established labor unions were developing harmonious relations with capitalist interests. If, instead, the trade unions and the Communist Party had joined with the workers’ insurgency and tangibly opposed foreign investments undermining wages and working conditions, a more cohesive and powerful workers’ movement would have emerged (ibid.).

In factories with a deeper political consciousness—the product of a major political struggle—no wage labor is contracted. They have instead enlarged production by adding more workers with the same status as the original cooperative members. For example, at Brukman only 32 out of 132 factory workers supported the entire struggle process and eventually founded the cooperative. When production increased they added more workers, who also became part of the cooperative with the same rights as the original members. The same happened at Zanón, where the new workers were unemployed individuals recruited from the piquetero movement that had supported the occupation of the factory.

There have been important modifications regarding the distribution of tasks among workers. Research carried out with Zanón workers shows that the majority of workers (52 percent) have switched from their previous job assignments (Chirico et al. 2003). In the majority of taken factories, the number of workers that held on throughout the struggle and resisted until the formation of the cooperative is smaller than the workforce formerly employed by the capitalist firm. Thus when production begins again many tasks must be reassigned. Other factors also contribute. In order to increase productivity, for instance, workers have become more versatile. One Brukman worker said that prior to the factory occupation she only sewed pockets, but now, once finished with sewing, she performs other functions to finish a garment. In addition, the common experience of the struggle has reduced prior mistrust among workers, and what were formerly craft secrets are now shared openly with coworkers.

Most factory seizures result from unproductive operation by the capitalist owners; thus, just a few of the occupied factories in Venezuela, such as the water tap and pipe factory INAF, have been able to produce under workers’ control. INAF, like many other Venezuelan and Latin American worker-expropriated factories, has obsolete machinery and needs huge financial investments to perpetuate efficient production. In this capacity, state support is crucial, because apart from the private sector—which is so resistant to workers’ control—the state is the only entity capable of making such investments. Without state support these factories have to compete on the terms of the capitalist market and adapt to its rules.

For nearly two years following the comanagement accord, the workers tried to manage Inveval on their own without being guided by capitalist logic. But ultimately the workers concluded that their aim was not feasible. Separation of the labor and decision-making arenas contributed to worker apathy and isolation of the board of directors. The legal framework made direct administration by all the workers impossible. As part owners, the workers were also pushed toward assuming capitalist logic: the cooperative did not just own a share of the factory but also its debt. The workers complained that they were drawn into the cycle of living to work and pay the debt. “The cooperative feeds capitalism because it’s created as part of the capitalist system and that’s what we don’t want.... We didn’t kick out one capitalist to create 60 new ones” (Gonzalez 2008).

The transformation and democratization of the economy has proved the most difficult. The administration of most companies is neither under workers’ nor community control. Surrounded by a capitalist system and logic, it has been extremely challenging to establish collective production processes. Questions over the distribution of work and the resulting gains are particularly conflictive. However, where workers have succeeded in gaining control of their workplace, it can be observed that they have usually developed solidarity ties with surrounding communities, abolished hierarchical structures, made themselves accountable to the workers’ assembly, and in most cases introduced equal salaries and increased the number of employed workers.

They were funded by creditors of the former company who live on the mill’s lands. Overall, between agriculture and industry, the project involves about four thousand families, or about twenty thousand people. In addition to the forty-eight mills and the main sugar mill the property also includes the aforementioned hydroelectric plant, a pottery workshop, a carpentry workshop, a hospital, seven irrigation dams and channels, one vehicle fleet (tractors, trucks, etc.), and several “mansions,” one of which was converted into an educational center.181 In the first seven years of the project, the illiteracy rate among its members dropped from 82 percent to 16.7 percent.182

Finally, in the autumn of 1926, on the pretext of an alleged attempt on his life, Mussolini decided to make an end of even the semblance of bourgeois democracy that still survived. All remaining opposition organisations and their publications were banned, and a new, massive series of arrests was launched throughout the country. Among those arrested was Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci was a member of parliament-but the regime was no longer interested in niceties about parliamentary immunity. He had also, since August 1924, been the general secretary of the Communist Party-though of course under such political conditions the identity of party officials was kept secret. He was 35 years old.

The proletariat of Turin was the most advanced and combative in Italy. As early as 1904-6, it had demonstrated a high degree of solidarity and a readiness to take to the streets. Although it suffered a series of massive defeats in 1907, which were followed by years which saw the apogee of Giolittian "industrial peace" and the rapid growth of a collaborationist trade-union movement, nevertheless in 1912 the metal-workers (those not organised in unions!) embarked upon a strike "to the end". This was defeated, after 75 days of struggle; but the metalworkers came out again-this time led by the union, the FIOM in the spring of 1913, and after a 93-day strike won a considerable victory (partly as a result of government intervention against the employers' dangerous intransigence).

the party leadership remained true to its "abstentionist" principles. Though positive as far as it went, this had some extremely negative consequences for the future. For the leadership had a "left" enough position to prevent the emergence of any effective organised Left until well after the war, while it was in no genuine sense revolutionary in its practice; at the same time, it profoundly alienated the petit-bourgeois strata-susceptible to patriotic slogans -who were to provide the social basis for fascism.

"Neither support, nor sabotage", for what was in effect nothing but a policy of "clean hands". He wrote: "Revolutionaries see history as a creation of their own spirit, as being made up of a continuous series of violent tugs at the other forces of society-both active and passive, and they prepare the maximum of favourable conditions for the definitive tug (revolution); they must not be content with the provisional slogan 'absolute neutrality', but must transform it into that of 'active, operative neutrality'." It quickly became clear, of course, that Mussolini's perspective was a very different one, and Gramsci did not venture into print again for over a year. Despite his irreproachable record of opposition to the imperialist war in the ensuing years, the accusation of "interventionism" was still to be hurled at him years later by political opponents, on the basis of this one article.

In August 1917, on the occasion of yet another failure of bread supplies, the Turin proletariat rose in a spontaneous insurrection. Barricades went up in the working-class quarters, and the centre of the city was besieged. In so far as there was any organisation on the insurgent side, it was provided by the anarchists. The intransigent socialist leaders were as impotent as the reformist deputies or trade union officials. This impotence of the socialist leaders was to be demonstrated repeatedly during the next three years.

This is not the place for an analysis of the theoretical position worked out in the pages of the weekly Ordine Nuovo in the twenty months of its existence. Its main features, however, and also its main weaknesses must be indicated briefly, for an appreciation of its relation to Gramsci’s mature thought. The idea of “Soviets” was common currency on the Italian Left in this period, from the reformists at one extreme to Bordiga, whose journal in Naples was entitled Il Soviet, at the other. But Ordine Nuovo distinguished itself from the rest of the Left in four important ways. First, and most important, it related its theories directly to the practice of the Turin working class; it had a programme for the realisation of a soviet system, and fought for that programme. By the summer of 1920, there were councils in all the main factories of the city. Secondly, the new institutions were to be completely independent of the traditional working-class organisations; they were to be institutions of the whole proletariat, including non-organised workers, anarchists, etc. This conception was bitterly attacked by all sectors of the Italian Left, and was the real cause of Tasca’s dissent. For Gramsci’s conception saw the councils as the institutions whereby the dictatorship of the proletariat would be exercised, institutions which stood towards the “voluntary”, “private” associations such as the party and the trade union in a relation of “State” to “government”. This apparent subordination of the traditional working-class organisations was a source of scandal to the Left as a whole, for whom Serrati certainly spoke when he asserted that “the dictatorship of the proletariat is the conscious dictatorship of the Socialist Party”.

However, it was not until the spring of 1920, on the eve of the great Turin metalworkers' strike, that Gramsci began to pose correctly the relation between mass institutions and the revolutionary party. He then wrote an article — destined, to the horror of the P.S.I, delegates, to be described by Lenin as "fully in keeping with the fundamental principles of the Third International" — entitled "For a Renewal of the Socialist Party", in which he said, notably: "The existence of a cohesive and strongly disciplined Communist Party which, through its factory, trade-union and co-operative nuclei, co-ordinates and centralises within its own executive committee all of the proletariat's revolutionary activity, is the fundamental and indispensable condition for attempting any Soviet experiment." But by this time, as Gramsci was to recognise with bitter self- criticism in subsequent years, the task of national co-ordination of the proletariat's revolutionary activity had been left too late. The April metalworkers' strike was in fact the high point of revolutionary mass struggle in the postwar years; and it was only after its defeat that the Ordine Nuovo group attempted to sink its theoretical differences with Bordiga, in order to participate in the process of creating an Italian Communist Party.

Throughout 1925, the fascist regime intensified the dictatorial character of its rule. The P.C.L's traditional view equating fascism and social-democracy was not abandoned, but it now began to be accompanied by a new awareness of fascism as a unifier of the ruling class and expression of its interests. "Fascism has given back to the bourgeoisie a class consciousness and class organisation", wrote Gramsci in February; at about the same time he wrote to Julia in Moscow that it was no longer possible to expect "any very imminent end to fascism as a regime .

Increasingly, Gramsci was forced back into himself. Much of the time, particularly towards the end of his stay in Turi, he was too ill even to read or write. Hunchbacked, sickly, having suffered at least three major breakdowns of his health even when he was free and able to enjoy medical attention and maintain a special diet, his years in prison were literally an eleven-year death-agony. His teeth fell out, his digestive system collapsed so that he could not eat solid food, his chronic insomnia became permanent so that he could go weeks without more than an hour or two of sleep at night; he had convulsions when he vomited blood, and suffered from headaches so violent that he beat his head against the walls of his cell. It is against this background that the achievement of the Prison Notebooks should be seen.

The ideas of the Free Trade movement are based on a theoretical error whose practical origin is not hard to identify; they are based on a distinction between political society and civil society,210 which is made into and presented as an organic one, whereas in fact it is merely methodological. Thus it is asserted that economic activity belongs to civil society, and that the State must not intervene to regulate it. But since in actual reality civil society and State are one and the same, it must be made clear that laissez-faire too is a form of State "regulation", introduced and maintained by legislative and coercive means. It is a deliberate policy, conscious of its own ends, and not the spontaneous, automatic expression of economic facts. Consequently, laissez-faire liberalism is a political programme, designed to change—in so far as it is victorious—a State's leading personnel, and to change the economic programme of the State itself-—in other words the distribution of the national income.

The expression "consciousness of purpose" might appear humorous to say the least to anyone who recalls Taylor's phrase about the "trained gorilla".382 Taylor is in fact expressing with brutal cynicism the purpose of American society—developing in the worker to the highest degree automatic and mechanical attitudes, breaking up the old psycho-physical nexus of qualified professional work, which demands a certain active participation of intelligence, fantasy and initiative on the part of the worker, and reducing productive operations exclusively to the mechanical, physical aspect.

As Catholics, making Catholicism a norm of life, are we making a mistake or are we right? Everyone has a vague intuitive feeling that when they make Catholicism a norm of life they are making a mistake, to such an extent that nobody attaches himself to Catholicism as a norm of life, even when calling himself a Catholic. An integral Catholic, one, that is, who applied the Catholic norms in every act of his life, would seem a monster. Which, when you come to think about it, is the severest and most peremptory criticism of Catholicism itself.

The European Union is liberal in the classical sense of upholding the rights of private property against the state and of entrenching market relationships, and also in the more modern connotation of supporting individual freedoms – including, saliently, the right to live and work anywhere within its borders – and opposition to gender, ethnic, religious or other forms of discrimination. Its ‘internationalism’ offers the free movement of people within the Union (if not free movement into it from the rest of the world), as well as mandating the free movement of capital, goods and services. That makes it good enough for some on the left. But though it may be liberal, the EU is no more than a parody of a democracy, governed by an inaccessible bureaucracy barely answerable to a powerless Parliament. The ‘remain and reform’ mantra with which left-Remainers concealed their nakedness was absurd. There is no prospect of serious reform in the EU’s purpose and functioning, absent the election of Corbyn-type governments in all the decisive countries in Europe: a circumstance which would be as likely to precipitate the end of the EU as presently constituted and its supersession by some form of socialist federation.

Solidarity with the Palestinian people, support for the anti-war movement, unwillingness to commit to nuclear destruction, opposition to the Anglo-American embrace of Saudi Arabia, defence of Venezuela’s embattled socialists, scepticism about the further expansion of NATO – these positions are popular with Party members.

Although equality retains its emotional and ethical appeal, I don’t think we can rely on this framing to communicate an effective broader practice. The misuse of the word, including through shallow bureaucratic practices and the cruelties of austerity, combined with the growth of an everyday consciousness (among the young at least) that ‘equality’ for some has masked dehumanisation for others, means that our championing of this principle no longer differentiates us from others. More than this, the claim of pursuing equality has lost much of its operationalising credibility. People are painfully aware that formal equality is implemented in ways that feel like punishment for many – while the underside of formal equality via bureaucracy has resulted in exclusion, destitution and abandonment for those deemed beyond the reach of such measures.

In 1969, Rupert Murdoch had taken control of the Sun – formerly the Daily Herald, which was once a hugely popular paper and an organ of the labour movement – and transformed it into a populist right-wing outlet. Thatcher’s coterie developed a close alliance with Murdoch and his editors, as well as with the traditional organs of popular conservatism: the Mail and the Express. Together these titles formed a potent machinery of reactionary propaganda. The proportion of the newspaper market supporting the Conservative Party shot up from around half to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent. The alliances forged, and the backroom deals made, between media owners and politicians in those years have since been revealed by the Leveson Inquiry and official documents disclosed under the thirty-year rule. As was suspected but always denied, Thatcher supported Murdoch’s bid for The Times and The Sunday Times in 1981, and his right-wing stranglehold on the industry was later secured with a victory over the print unions in the Wapping dispute of 1986.

The core of current right-wing electoral coalitions comprises propertied pensioners and home-owners at or near the end of their working lives.* The material interests of this cohort are tied to the value of residential real estate and, because their pensions are invested in stock markets, the performance of the financial sector. The material interests of the propertyless young are opposed to those of this older cohort.

But we must admit that this can work because every state in the world is doing it – that is where the MMT theorists were wrong. Usually, what the bond traders are looking at are the spreads – what is the size of the Italian deficit compared to the German one. Insofar as deficits are exploding everywhere, the disciplining effect of the bond vigilantes is less powerful. Now, in a sense, this disciplining effect never exists for the US. The US deficit was already through the roof, it’s now going through the stratosphere. And the world is still rushing to get US dollars because it’s the one store of value in the world economy. This crisis is demonstrating that the argument Sam Gindin and I put forward about the internationalisation of the US state – that is, it being the state of global capitalism – is correct. The US state is the protector of capital at a global level, and property owners all over the world look to the US state as their protector, even as they wonder whether or not the US state can play that role.

Over the course of past decades, the production of food has been enveloped into a global supply chain. Farmers cannot simply take their produce to market; they must sell it into a system that processes, transports and then packages food for sale at a variety of retail outlets. Even this is not so simple, as the world of finance has enmeshed the farmer into speculation. In 2010, the United Nations’ former special rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, wrote about the way that hedge funds, pension funds and investment banks overpower agriculture with speculation through commodity derivatives. These financial houses, he wrote, are ‘generally unconcerned with agricultural market fundamentals’.* If there is any shock to the system, the entire chain collapses and farmers are often forced to burn or bury their food rather than allow it to be eaten. As Aime Williams writes of the situation in the United States, these are ‘scenes out of the Great Depression: farmers destroying their products as Americans line up by the thousands outside food banks’.

With the global financial and monetary system of Bretton Woods deteriorating in the 1960s, US monetary imperialism underwent a major transformation. First, by suspending the gold convertibility of the dollar in 1971, US Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker removed the cap on America’s balance of payments. In an ingenious reversion, instead of acting as the world’s creditor (drawing on its now-depleted gold reserves), the US would become its chief debtor. By greasing the wheels of commerce, and the palms of politics, with a flood of American treasury bonds, it would remain the world economy’s ‘indispensable nation’, still capable of exercising outsized authority – but now through a more elastic financial instrument. The US reserved the right to threaten war should anyone try to call in the tab. But instead of underwriting reconstruction in Europe, it would use this liquidity to perfuse the late-industrialising nations – and in that regard, China, with its great reserves of labour, held the most potential.

In terms of GDP, this new tactic was a wild success: the economy grew at some 10 per cent per annum – the fastest pace in recorded history. By the late 2000s, Chinese GDP had surpassed Japan’s and China had become the world’s second-largest economy.

This argument can be traced back to Adam Smith, who posited an inverse relationship between profit and capital stock caused by intensified competition and consequent innovation. Rudolf Hilferding also argued that in certain specific historical conditions, competition could hinder long-term accumulation. The claim here is therefore twofold. First, labour-intensive sectors (such as garments, footwear, toys, furniture, etc.) that employ much of the global industrial working class are defined by the logic of competition, which moves them inexorably in the direction of consolidation, thereby reducing the monopsonistic power of buyers. Second, changes in the value chain are reflected in the bargaining power of workers.

The strategy of stageism, of accelerating the conditions of capitalism to arrive at socialism, died in 1953. It’s clear that socialism will not arrive from above, but must be built from below. The COVID-19 pandemic is making visible many of capitalism’s abstractions. The new conditions of increasingly fortified states, national chauvinism and the uneven distribution of global capitalism require an extra-parliamentary and extra-national strategy. This strategy necessitates a predictive analysis of a highly integrated global production process, including mapping the logics that shape its contours, identifying its key chokepoints and nodes, and building links between workers and their organisations to maximise their disruptive power.

Positing the idea that Britain is uniquely stupid could lend itself to an inverted nationalism, a turning of the pyramid that leaves its basic structures intact. After all, the authoritarian obsession with instinct over analysis, feeling over fact, has turned the loose sediment of anti-intellectualism into a cornerstone of the Brexit project. Boris Johnson’s marked refusal to fall into line behind the rest of Europe, as well as much of the rest of the world, is highly revealing. Britain’s nineteenth-century victory in the ‘game’ of competitive colonialism has deformed the national political culture along the lines of a particular delusion of grandeur, as well as a longstanding belief that politics is mere sport. The US’s similar handling of the crisis suggests that imperialism deforms the political capacities of its supposed victors as well as destroying the lives of its victims.

Conservatism of all stripes is, in the end, a defence of inequality. While neoliberalism rationalised inequality through meritocracy – thereby more easily sustaining the rhetoric of liberal democracy – Johnsonism is a bolder, more capricious assertion of social hierarchy: in place of aspiration, private property and individual success, it offers merely a bullish defence of entitlement.

There is no necessary contradiction between combining stricter controls on trade unions and the deregulation of labour markets on the one hand, with raising government investment and pushing industrial policy on the other. The intellectual error would be to maintain that the expansion of the state necessarily represents a positive alternative to capitalism as such and that the suppression of finance necessarily represents a progressive moment.

Across the world, we are seeing a dramatic shrinkage in the proportion of people employed in full-time ‘standard’ work. According to the International Labour Organisation, as of 2019 just 53 per cent of the world’s employed population are waged, salaried workers – and of this group, 40 per cent rely on informal income streams to compensate for inadequate wages. In turn, more than 470 million people are underutilised, meaning they remain precariously tethered to the world of employment: they are not classified as ‘unemployed’, yet their access to paid work is unpredictable and insufficient to sustain themselves and their families.

Austerity was neoliberalism’s response to the 2008 financial crash, with a narrative that turned a real crisis of capitalism (at the time the deepest and sharpest recession the UK had experienced since the Second World War) into a perceived crisis of ‘too much public spending’ and ‘too large’ a deficit – a clear and graspable explanation of what had occurred, despite being factually untrue. This sleight of hand successfully laid the blame for a global economic crisis at Labour’s door.

After the 2019 election, We Own It commissioned new polling to find out why people support public ownership. The two most popular reasons were: people want money to be reinvested in services rather than going to shareholders; and people believe ‘privately owned companies prioritise profitable areas over providing a good service to everyone.’ Most of us believe that public funding from the taxes that we all pay should go towards improving services. And we understand that private companies running public services have the wrong priorities, cherry picking which services they provide rather than providing a genuinely universal service.

The central claim of all anti-humanisms (where they are not merely condemnations of humanity) is that society, where it is even acknowledged as such, is a machine or system which exceeds and escapes human beings and cannot be said to have its origin in them. This is, of course, a key pillar of neoliberal ideology (deference to the market as a rational substitute for ‘society’), now bolstered by the ubiquity of algorithmic systems of control which do indeed appear to ‘exceed’ human beings.

Revealingly, apart from a tokenistic nod to Nelson Mandela, Hutton made no acknowledgement of Africans shaping their own political destiny, and seemingly held no conception of Africans as historical agents. As for the upper echelons of Oxford University’s leadership, the chancellor Lord Patten conflated RMF with the practice of no-platforming, arguing that students unable to embrace freedom of thought and expression ‘should think about being educated elsewhere’, even though Patten himself had declined their invitation to debate the issue.

Even though FeminismTM shares with corporate feminism a concern for representation within existing institutions, its adherents are more personally ambitious. Feminism-as-brand isn’t about promoting corporate profitability, although it can be profitable: a certain kind of sanitised feminism sells, one that doesn’t threaten existing power structures but is instead easily folded into them. FeminismTM is a financial and political grift: a quick route to a book deal, a good way to get on the news. More than this, it allows women in the male-dominated field of politics to position themselves beyond critique. While corporate feminism encourages a narrow kind of feminine business acumen, centrist feminism foregrounds women’s vulnerability and fragility even as it stresses their gutsiness. This isn’t to say that there aren’t gendered, even misogynistic factors at play in the criticism of many centrist women, nor to deny the harassment that they face. Simply being a woman, however, is not an exemption from scrutiny. Nor is it a reason, on its own, for feminist support.

Women, their actions and the idea of ‘femininity’ itself do not exist outside history, politics and power. To secure a better future for women, we need a feminism that can adequately grasp this. We need socialist feminism – that is one that builds sustainable social institutions of women’s collective power and of working-class power: a feminism that takes seriously Marx’s theoretical contribution, but pushes it to its limits, developing it and creating new analytical categories, rather than treating it with the reverence that a child might do a precious toy.

But Dewey added a further insight: “The attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance.”5 In other words, electing politicians critical of business will not eliminate business’s power to shape government policy. History supports Dewey’s point. Governments elected with a strong progressive mandate, from Chile in the early 1970s to Venezuela and Greece more recently, have faced massive economic disruption—and often military coups—when their reforms pose a threat to the profits and privileges of capitalists. Less ambitious would-be reformers like Barack Obama have also incurred the wrath of business despite taking enormous pains to accommodate corporate interests.

In 494 BCE, plagued by problems of debt, the plebeians staged the first of several mass walkouts from the city, a combination of a mutiny and a strike, to try to force reform on the patricians. It worked. For it launched a long series of concessions which gradually eroded all the significant differences between patricians and plebeians and effectively rewrote the political power structure of the city. Two hundred years later there was little to patrician privilege beyond the right to hold a few ancient priesthoods and to wear a particular form of fancy footwear.

It would probably have surprised both Pliny and Trajan to discover that 2,000 years later the most famous of their exchanges is to do with an apparently insignificant, but awkward and time-consuming, new religious group: the Christians. Pliny admitted that he was not sure how to handle them. To start with he had given them several opportunities to recant and executed only those who would not do so (‘their stubbornness and unbending obstinacy certainly ought to be punished’). But then many more names were brought to his attention, as people started to settle old scores by accusing their enemies of being Christian. Pliny continued to allow those under investigation to recant, so long as they proved their sincerity by pouring wine and incense in front of statues of the emperor and the true gods. But in order to find out what was at the bottom of all this, he had two Christian slave women tortured and questioned (in both ancient Greece and Rome, slaves were allowed to give legal evidence only under torture) and concluded that Christianity was ‘nothing other than a perverse and unruly superstition’.

The letters between Pliny and Trajan amount to one of the most loquacious non-Christian discussions of the new religion to survive. The Christian texts of the third, fourth and fifth centuries CE are some of the most extreme examples ever of the rewriting of history to fit the agenda of the winners. They construct a triumphalist history of Christianity as victorious both against its pagan rivals, despite cruel persecution by the Roman state, and against all the internal variants (‘heresies’, as later Christians defined them), which challenged what came to be Christian orthodoxy.

Among the many symptoms of unease and crisis that have afflicted us in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory is the extraordinary uncouth variety of postfactual politics that he personifies. He doesn’t tell the truth. He doesn’t make sense. He doesn’t speak coherently. Power appears to have become unmoored from the basic values of reason, logical consistency and factual evidence. What has caused this degeneration? One can cite a complex of factors. Certainly unscrupulous political demagoguery, the debasement of popular culture and the self-enclosed world of cable TV and social media are part of the problem, as is Trump’s personality. But to attribute our current state of postfactuality to Trump and his cohorts is to succumb only to further delusion.51 As this book will show, what the history of the crisis demonstrates are truly deep-seated and persistent difficulties in dealing “factually” with our current situation. It isn’t just those denounced as populists who have a problem with truth. It goes far wider and far deeper and it affects the center as much as the margins of mainstream politics. We do not need to go back to the notoriously misleading and incoherent case made for the war against Iraq and its fawning media coverage. It was the current president of the European Commission who announced in the spring of 2011: “When it becomes serious, you have to lie.”52 At least, one might say, he knows what he’s doing. If we believe Jean-Claude Juncker, a posttruth approach to public discourse is simply what the governance of capitalism currently demands.

As Clinton’s Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin’s great boast was to have turned the deficits of the Reagan era into substantial budget surpluses. Since then under the Republicans, America was headed fast in the wrong direction. In June 2001, in the wake of the dot-com bust and a disputed election, the Bush administration had delivered a tax cut estimated to cost the federal government $1.35 trillion over ten years.6 This paid off key constituencies, but it also wiped out Rubin’s surpluses and it did so deliberately. The Republicans had convinced themselves that surpluses tended to encourage more government spending. Their approach was the obverse, what Republican strategists of the Reagan era first dubbed “starving the beast.”7 By entrenching tax cuts and courting a fiscal crisis they would create an irresistible imperative to slash spending, curb entitlements to social welfare and shrink the footprint of government.

For home owners on fixed interest, long-term mortgages, the inflation of the post–Bretton Woods era was a windfall. The real value of their loans was eaten up while their interest rates remained fixed. For the banks that lent to them it was a disaster. In an era of inflation and fluctuating interest rates, at the capped interest rates inherited from the 1950s they could not retain their depositors, let alone attract new ones. To borrow from money markets or issue bonds, they now faced the withering interest rates set by the Fed. Meanwhile, their portfolios of fixed interest mortgages were devalued as rates on new loans soared.11 By the early 1980s the vast majority of the almost four thousand savings-and-loan banks still in operation were insolvent.

In a repo, the main flexible source of funds for investment banks, other banks acting as “broker-dealers” took securities as collateral in exchange for cash. What were they to do with their large stockpiles of collateral? Why not use this collateral as collateral in further repo loans, this time on behalf of the broker itself, a so-called reverse repo? In the United States, under regulations that went back to 1934, such rehypothecation of collateral was strictly limited to no more than 140 percent of the collateral being held. In the UK there was no limit on rehypothecation. As a result, according to investigations by a team of analysts from the IMF, the City of London came to function as a “platform for higher leveraging not available in the United States.” The scale of this activity was enormous. According to the IMF team, trading in and out of London the main European and US banks achieved a collateral multiplication of 400 percent, amounting to roughly $4.5 trillion in additional funding, effectively out of thin air.

As both household consumption and business investment plummeted, of the sixty countries that supply the IMF with quarterly GDP statistics, fifty-two registered a contraction in the second quarter of 2009.67 Not since records began had there been such a massive synchronized recession. Tens of millions of people were thrown into unemployment. Though it was dazed bankers with boxes of belongings stumbling out of office towers in London and New York that attracted the TV cameras, it was young, unskilled blue-collar workers who suffered the worst.68 In the United States, the epicenter of the crisis, the month-on-month fall in employment over the winter of 2008–2009 was breathtaking. In the worst period, the monthly rate of job losses topped 800,000. Among the African American population the surge was particularly dramatic, with unemployment rising from 8 percent in 2007 to 16 percent by early 2010.69 Young black workers were particularly hard hit, with their unemployment rate surging to 32.5 percent by January 2010.

Tim Geithner, from his vantage point at the New York Fed, gave a typically hard-boiled insight into his perspective on the struggle to save the financial system: “I didn’t have a way to explain the terror of those days until later, when I saw The Hurt Locker, the Oscar-winning film about a bomb disposal unit in Iraq. What we went through on interminable conference calls in fancy office buildings obviously did not compare with the horrors of war, but ten minutes into the movie I knew I had finally found something that captured what the crisis felt like: the overwhelming burden of responsibility combined with the paralyzing risk of catastrophic failure; the frustration about the stuff out of your control; the uncertainty about what would help; the knowledge that even good decisions might turn out badly; the pain and guilt of neglecting your family; the loneliness and the numbness.”

the decision made by the American crisis fighters to take those questions off the table and to give absolute priority to saving the financial system shaped everything else that followed. It set the stage for a remarkable and bitterly ironic inversion. Whereas since the 1970s the incessant mantra of the spokespeople of the financial industry had been free markets and light touch regulation, what they were now demanding was the mobilization of all of the resources of the state to save society’s financial infrastructure from a threat of systemic implosion, a threat they likened to a military emergency.

Recapitalization was a more direct way of intervening in a bank. It was also efficient. Every dollar of bank capital was leveraged. So a dollar of government capital would support ten, twenty or thirty times as much in lending. But recapitalization was rejected on political grounds. Paulson had no desire to go down in history as the Treasury secretary who nationalized America’s banking system. And even if Paulson had been willing to pay the personal price, an open call for government recapitalization would never have passed Congress. The Republicans would have voted en bloc against nationalization, and without bipartisan cover the Democrats could not take the risk.45 Already in the spring of 2008 the Treasury team thus decided that asset purchases were the path of least resistance. Buying debts did not involve ownership of banks. It did not raise issues of control or corporate governance. It could all be done through “the market.” An auction mechanism could be used to determine the price. It was also, admittedly, slow moving and expensive: $700 billion would cover barely more than half the outstanding subprime securitization. It wasn’t the perfect solution. But after Lehman, AIG and WaMu, the Treasury and the Fed were desperate. They needed something that might pass, and pass quickly.

The path from Lehman to TARP was less one of a sovereign state rising to a crisis than of a dysfunctional power struggle within the social and political network that tied Washington, DC, to Wall Street and to the European financial system beyond. In September political and commercial considerations had prevented a deal to save Lehman. It took a month of panic, political confusion and unprecedented financial turmoil to reach the point in mid-October when the barons of Wall Street would listen when Paulson thumped the table and declared that everyone must take the Treasury’s money. Even then, the executive branch had the power that it appeared to do in large part because J.P. Morgan swung behind the Treasury proposal. If this was an act of sovereignty, whose sovereignty was it? The American state’s, or that of the “new Wall Street”—the network personified by figures like Paulson and Geithner who tied the Treasury and the Fed to America’s globalized financial sector?

A key element of this program was a demand from the Kremlin that the oligarchs sink a large part of their fortunes into stabilizing the stock market. There were rumors of an “all-night mandatory meeting held in the Kremlin” on September 16, the day of the AIG rescue, at which “oligarchs were ordered to plunge cash into their own faltering stocks, buy collapsing financial institutions directly, or simply fork over the cash and/or shares.”14 Following this “bail-in” of the oligarchs, the government targeted takeovers and bailouts at the smallest and weakest Russian banks. Coordination was provided by state-owned Vneshekonombank (VEB), where Putin, as Russian prime minister, served as chairman of the board. Five billion dollars was used to take over Sviaz Bank, Globex bank and Sobinbank. Then the deposit insurance fund was recapitalized and the insurance limit raised to $28,000. A $50 billion central bank facility put VEB bank in a position to act as the backstop, with a further $35.4 billion in subordinated debt available at tough rates for troubled oligarch enterprises. The loans would be repayable within a year and otherwise convertible into controlling shares.15 It was not a government takeover, but a conditional threat and a stark demonstration of where power lay.

What would happen if an oligarch failed in his responsibilities was demonstrated in June 2009 when Putin descended on Pikalevo, a small town south of St. Petersburg dominated by the metallurgical empire of Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska, who had once been listed as the richest man in Russia, with a fortune estimated at $28 billion, had seen it reduced to $3.5 billion. But that was no excuse for not paying wages.20 Indignant workers were blockading the Moscow highway, causing a 250-mile traffic jam. In front of the TV cameras Putin upbraided Deripaska. Tossing him a pen, the premier demanded that the oligarch sign the paychecks there and then. It was economic management by personal intimidation of the telegenic tub-thumping variety.21 The message was clear. Ten years on from the humiliation of 1998, there were men in charge who would see to it that things “got done.”

The popularly minded leadership team of President Hu Jintao had opened discussions of health-care reform already in 2005 in the wake of the SARS crisis. Something needed to be done about the glaring disparities in health coverage between rural and urban areas.17 After several years of debate, the economic emergency of 2008 swung the decision quite suddenly toward a system centered on central government spending. On April 7, 2009, Beijing announced that health insurance coverage would be extended from 30 to 90 percent of China’s population and that central funds would be allocated to pay for the construction of two thousand county hospitals and five thousand township-level clinical centers. It was the largest expansion in health-care provision in world history to date and it was “inextricably interwoven with the stimulus package.” Beijing was happy to approve spending on hospitals, clinics and public insurance subsidies “because concerns about short-run deficits” had “evaporated …. The economic crisis … opened a window in which a more aggressive fiscal approach to social policy has become possible.”

in practice, Chinese central government is stretched thinly across the giant bulk and complexity of the world’s most populous nation. Though responsibility for revenue collection falls heavily on central government, government expenditure directly controlled from Beijing has amounted to no more than 4 to 5 percent of GDP since the 1990s, a very small figure by comparison with its American or European counterparts. In China, 80 percent of government spending is done at the regional and local levels, where expenditure has surged between 1994 and 2008 from 8 to 18 percent of GDP, even as China’s national income quintupled.

In Britain, the most egregious case was RBS, a now majority state-owned bank that announced in February 2009 that it intended to honor £1 billion in bonus contracts.4 In the United States the figures were far larger. In the 2008 bonus season, after suffering tens of billions in losses, Wall Street paid out $18.4 billion to its top staff. That was two and a half times the amount that Congress approved for the president’s priority of modernizing America’s broadband infrastructure. Alternatively, if it had been retained by the banks, it would have made a substantial contribution toward their recapitalization.5 But the investment banks weren’t conventional public companies. They were partnerships run primarily for the benefit of their managerial elite and they expected to be paid, whatever happened.

And it made sure to pay out earlier than normal in December 2008, just after the firm revealed a fourth quarter loss of $21.5 billion and days before it collapsed into the reluctant embrace of Bank of America.6 But of all the bonus scandals, the one that really caught the public’s attention was AIG. It closed its fourth quarter of 2008 with a loss of $61.7 billion, the largest in US corporate history. Nevertheless, on March 16, 2009, the company announced that its Financial Products division, which had been at the heart of the toxic spill, would be awarding $165 million in bonuses, a figure that might rise to as much as $450 million.

As they put it cagily: It was undeniable that “significant uncertainties around” the program made it “difficult to state categorically” that Greece would ever be able to pay back its debts. Normally this would be a red flag. Who, after all, would benefit from Greece taking on new loans from official lenders to pay off existing private debts it could not service? The outspoken Brazilian board member insisted that the program not be referred to as “a rescue of Greece, which will have to undergo a wrenching adjustment, but as a bailout of Greece’s private debt holders, mainly European financial institutions.”

The IMF board approved the disproportionate and risky Greek bailout not because it made sense in its own terms, or was good for Greece, but because on the track record to date, Europe’s inability to contain the Greek crisis meant that there was “high risk of international systemic spillover effects.”66 Instead of restructuring Greek’s unsustainable debts, what would be restructured were its entire public sector and its creaky economy. Heroic assumptions about cost cutting and efficiency gains were the ways in which the IMF squared the Greek program with its conscience. Perhaps if it were shaken thoroughly enough, “sclerotic” and “clientelistic” Greece could be jolted onto a higher growth path that would make its debts sustainable after all. Austerity and “reform” were the only items on the agenda that the otherwise divided parties to the deal could agree on. Whether this was economically effective or politically sustainable and what it would mean for the democratic politics of Europe was another matter altogether.

If the Greeks were the victims of extend-and-pretend, who were the beneficiaries? Billions of euros from the first tranche of the May 2010 program were disbursed to Athens, which in turn paid them to its creditors. Those who were lucky enough to hold debt expiring in 2010 or 2011 were paid on time and in full. Those banks that decided to cut their losses and sell out could find buyers among the hedge funds who picked up debt for as little as 36 cents on the euro, gambling that things could only get better and that in the worst case they would get some cut of a final settlement.52 French and Dutch banks seem to have been most active in breaching the informal embargo on Greek bond sales. French bank holdings of Greek debt fell between March and December 2010 from $27 billion to $15 billion, Dutch from $22.9 billion to $7.7 billion.53 But the flight out of Greek bonds did not extend to the entire periphery. As they sold off Greek and Irish bonds, Europe’s banks chased yield by rotating their money into Spanish and Italian bonds.

For all its brilliance, not the least remarkable thing about this editorial is where it put the blame. “The governments we ourselves elected” bore the historic guilt, not Ireland’s bankers, investors and their business partners across Europe and the wider world, not financial experts, economists and regulators. The loss of political sovereignty was no doubt painful. But who would really pay the price for “cleaning up the mess”? Would it be voters and taxpayers, or those who had profited from inflating the credit bubble? In the Greek case, at least, the debts were public. In Ireland taxpayers were being asked to pay for huge losses incurred by deeply irresponsible banks and their investors all over Europe. On December 7 Dublin announced a budget with a new round of 6 billion euros in cuts, half of what would have been saved if the bank bondholders had been haircut across the board.

In 2014, the business press reported that “cash on corporate balance sheets has increased almost 70 percent over the past four years,” that it was not being invested in the economy, and that this lack of investment constituted a collective decision to avoid productive investment: “Companies that are spending their cash have largely chosen to increase dividends and buy back stock” rather than increase hiring, wages, or productive investments.28 That is, business was refusing to reinvest its profits—which owed partly to Obama administration policies—back into the economy.

This dynamic was captured in a 2010 comment by former vice president Al Gore, bemoaning the failure of climate change legislation in the Senate. “The influence of special interests is now at an extremely unhealthy level,” Gore said. “And it’s to the point where it’s virtually impossible for participants in the current political system to enact any significant change without first seeking and gaining permission from the largest commercial interests who are most affected by the proposed change.”32 The following year, the White House scrapped a proposal to limit emissions of ozone, a key ingredient in smog.

And to the extent that the EPA seeks to protect the public against polluters, it draws ferocious corporate opposition that the military, law enforcement, or other conservative state agencies do not encounter. Anti-pollution measures may get a little support from renewable energy companies, but they lack the same degree of corporate backing that these other agencies enjoy.

Disagreement among these business and state actors often frustrates the efforts of individual institutions and industries. Sometimes that disagreement even opens the door to progressive reforms. The Obama administration’s 2010 healthcare reform and its overhaul of banking regulations both resulted largely from these disagreements among elites. Some business sectors wanted to rein in the health industries and the mega-banks because they themselves were being hurt by their unchecked greed and recklessness. Health costs were threatening employers’ profit margins, while the Wall Street crash of 2008 hurt many industries. This business discontent helped generate pressure for change, leading both political parties in the 2008 election to promise healthcare and financial reform.

Obama’s first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, effectively became “the government’s highest-ranking business lobbyist,” as the business press noted, directly negotiating foreign deals for Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Electric, and other companies. She pushed countries to embrace fracking for natural gas and Monsanto’s genetically modified seeds. Clinton also reoriented the State Department itself, converting it “into a machine for promoting U.S. business.” She created the new position of chief economist, hired a former Wall Street banker for the job, and promoted “the embassy economic officers who act as State’s liaisons to business

It is worth noting that the economic crisis had nothing to do with onerous government regulations. Indeed, the lack of regulation had caused the crisis. And there was no “natural,” market-driven reason why granting Wall Street’s demands for light regulation would get credit flowing again. But there was a political reason: granting those demands might convince bankers to trust that the government was on its side, enough to release the capital needed to ease the economic disruption.

The two major Senate bills introduced after Waxman-Markey’s passage, the Kerry-Boxer (September 2009) and Kerry-Lieberman (May 2010) bills, followed suit.88 Unlike these other bills, a December 2009 Senate bill that proposed to auction off all emissions permits (while refunding 75 percent of proceeds directly to consumers) failed even to achieve serious consideration, and went nowhere.89 Pooley writes that although all the leading Democratic presidential candidates in 2008 had promised to support auctions for all permits, they “knew it would never make it into law, because [free] allowances were the sweetener any bill needed to get the power barons to sign on. Call them transitional assistance or call them bribes—if you didn’t have free allowances, you didn’t have industry.”90

In another parallel with healthcare and financial reform, the need to maintain the profitability of polluters generally went unquestioned. For most politicians, regulators, and commentators, the threat of capital flight and price hikes was not a political strategy but an objective law of nature: of course polluters would pass along their costs, and we would be powerless to stop them. This assumption is evident in journalist Eric Pooley’s own rebuttal to those who insisted that polluters should pay for their emissions permits: The punitive fantasy missed an important detail. The polluter wouldn’t really pay; the polluter’s customers would, because regulated utilities pass their costs to the rate payers … Heavy industries that released a great deal of carbon dioxide—paper-, cement-, and steel-makers, for instance—were already fighting for their lives against foreign competitors with lower labor costs. If cap and trade raised their energy costs, it could put them out of business or drive their manufacturing facilities overseas to non-cap-and-trade countries. You’d have to be crazy not to give them free allowances. It could be the difference between keeping them in business and letting them die.

A second and better-known historical example is the labor legislation of the 1930s. In this case, disruption caused a split between state and corporate elites. Incessant strikes and other working-class protests drove Congress to pass a bill guaranteeing workers’ right to collective bargaining, over the opposition of business leaders. As in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, state officials took it upon themselves to protect the long-term interests of business through system-stabilizing reform. Unlike with financial reform, there was no substantial business support for unionization rights. But there was a mass movement disruptive enough to neutralize the ferocious opposition of employers.

Wagner Act did not have the support of many capitalists when it was passed. Congress and the Roosevelt administration acted without the consent of corporate elites, who were almost unanimously opposed to the law at the time of its passage. Obama’s reforms met with capitalist opposition, but they also had support from counter-coalitions of capitalists. The Wagner Act is thus an example of how mass disruption can expand the limits of what is possible. It drove state elites to enact reforms over the fierce and unified opposition of business. Notably, however, the movement’s disruptive pressures were directed mainly at employers, not politicians. It was the latter who had the foresight to understand that continued unrest imperiled business profits and potentially capitalism itself.

Most non-enforcement decisions pass unnoticed. A comprehensive 2014 study by The Crime Report offered a stunning finding: the EPA almost never prosecutes business violations of environmental law. “More than 64,000 facilities are currently listed in agency databases as being in violation of federal environmental laws, but in most years, fewer than one-half of one percent of violations trigger criminal investigations.” The executive branch has full legal authority to prosecute any violation under the Clean Air and Water Acts, but actively chooses not to pursue criminal charges in all but a handful of cases. Thus, the study notes, “the vast majority of corporate environmental transgressions—even cases that involve the releases of large amounts of toxic chemicals—are relegated to civil and administrative enforcement.” The resulting fines are seldom a major deterrent, and executives often factor them into their budget projections.

Despite the rapid and profitable revival of the nine major Wall Street firms that received TARP funds, they did not restore lending to Main Street. Even the Congressional Oversight Panel in charge of monitoring TARP, which was not inclined to be overly critical, concluded that the program had only rescued Wall Street and not Main Street. After several months of TARP, “hundreds of billions of dollars have been injected into the marketplace with no demonstrable effects on lending.”31

But King’s own conclusion was somewhat different: All our marches in Albany were marches to the city hall trying to make them negotiate, where if we had centered our protests at the stores, the businesses in the city, [we could have] made the merchants negotiate … If you can pull them around, you pull the political power structure because really the political power structure listens to the economic power structure.25

President Eisenhower accepted this reality, ceding to the State Department and CIA the responsibility for determining what constituted the “national interest” and how best to advance it.99 Decisions were made after taking into account the nexus of corporate and state actors who had vested interests in the results. The president, Congress, and the judiciary played decidedly secondary roles and often none at all. Public opinion and electoral concerns were even less important.

While citizen pressure on elected officials had some impact, other factors were much more significant in ending the war. The principal factor was the resistance of the Vietnamese people. The strength and resilience of this movement generated economic disruption that led US business leaders to demand de-escalation. Then, as continued Vietnamese resistance and the domestic US antiwar movement led to growing resistance within the US military, the military leadership began to favor withdrawal as a lesser-evil option. The defeat of US intervention in Vietnam is a perfect case of disruptive protest activating corporate and institutional elites to dramatically revise US foreign policy.

Countless liberals, including some of Martin Luther King Jr.’s own advisers, had called his 1965 proposal for an Alabama boycott “stupid,” warning that it “could cost King much of the active white middle-class support that Selma had produced.”134 King responded by arguing that the tradeoff was worthwhile. “I don’t think in a social revolution you can always retain support of the moderates,” he said. If the newfound allies of the movement were alienated by confrontational tactics, they were unlikely to be of much value to the movement anyway. “I don’t think that a person who is truly committed is ever alienated completely by tactics.”135 Winning over politicians and the public can help a movement, but not if it means foregoing disruptive tactics.

the highly popular, democratically elected Iranian prime minister (and Time magazine’s Man of the Year in 1951), Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized all Iranian petroleum assets. An outraged England sought the help of her World War II ally, the United States. However, both countries feared that military retaliation would provoke the Soviet Union into taking action on behalf of Iran. Instead of sending in the Marines, therefore, Washington dispatched CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt (Theodore’s grandson). He performed brilliantly, winning people over through payoffs and threats. He then enlisted them to organize a series of street riots and violent demonstrations, which created the impression that Mossadegh was both unpopular and inept. In the end, Mossadegh went down, and he spent the rest of his life under house arrest. The pro-American Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi became the unchallenged dictator.

Peru was caught in a downward spiral of economic and social turmoil in 1983. This was exacerbated by terrorist activities and unmanageable external loans. After long negotiations, its debts were restructured in 1996. Elliott Associates, a hedge fund run by Paul Singer, a major supporter of political campaigns, purchased around $20 million of the defaulted Peruvian loans for about $11 million and then sued the country and its central bank for the original amount, plus interest, in a New York court. Elliott won a $58 million settlement and cleared $47 million in profit — a more than 400 percent rate of return on its investment. This windfall profit came at a huge cost to environmental and social programs in Peru.16

Vulture funds operate by buying up a country’s distressed debt just as the original lenders are about to write it off — usually, as the Guardian describes it, when the country ‘is in a state of chaos. When the country has stabilised, vulture funds return to demand millions of dollars in interest repayments and fees on the original debt.’” According to Jubilee USA, “As of late 2011, 16 of 40 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) surveyed by the International Monetary Fund were facing litigation in 78 individual cases brought by commercial creditors.

This was the basic inconsistency in the German position. Berlin was not just the relentless advocate of austerity. It was also the most consistent and clearheaded on restructuring and PSI. But when it came to its necessary concomitants, starting with backstopping the rest of the bond market, Berlin was inconsistent and incoherent. Nor did Berlin show any particular energy in recapitalizing its banks, allowing Hypo Real Estate and the weaker Landesbanken to become millstones around its neck. Bailing in creditors without backstopping the bond market and strengthening the banks was not so much responsible policy as a high-wire act that the ECB, the French and the Americans all regarded with horror. And this is the most charitable interpretation of Berlin’s motivations. The less charitable reading was that Germany was engaged in a strategy of tension, deliberately fostering market uncertainty to bully the rest of the eurozone into submission.27 Meanwhile, Germany enjoyed the privileges of a safe haven. While the PIIGS groaned under rising yields, Germany’s interest rates were sliding inexorably toward the zero lower bound. The uncertainty in the eurozone was not good for export business. But Germany’s exports to the rest of the world were booming. Labor markets were tightening. It was a long way from the affluence and complacency of Munich or Frankfurt to the turbulent streets of Madrid and Athens. Berlin could afford to wait it out.

Trillions of dollars of debt were losing their status as safe assets. The US Treasury was accused by the German finance minister of interventionist tendencies akin to communism. NATO was squabbling over Libya. The loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve was blamed for fomenting revolt in the Middle East. The EU was locked into a self-deceptive nonsolution to the Greek debt crisis, and when it was not engaged in extend-and-pretend it was openly and unabashedly lying. Both Italy’s prime minister and the managing director of the IMF were up on sex charges. Washington was willfully toying with bankruptcy. The ratings agencies could not do their arithmetic. Millions of people were in the streets, protesting, demanding a “rupture,” unable or unwilling to pay debts they had contracted or that had been contracted in their name.

In the summer of 2012 its staff revisited the forecasts they had made in the spring of 2010 as the eurozone crisis began and discovered that they had systematically underestimated the negative impact of budget cuts. Whereas they had started the crisis believing that the multiplier was on average around 0.5, they now concluded that from 2010 forward it had been in excess of 1.21 This meant that cutting government spending by 1 euro, as the austerity programs demanded, would reduce economic activity by more than 1 euro. So the share of the state in economic activity actually increased rather than decreased, as the programs presupposed. It was a staggering admission. Bad economics and faulty empirical assumptions had led the IMF to advocate a policy that destroyed the economic prospects for a generation of young people in Southern Europe.

Most things are forgotten over time. Even the war itself, the life-and-death struggle people went through, is now like something from the distant past. We’re so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past, like ancient stars that have burned out, are no longer in orbit about our minds. There are just too many things we have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn. New styles, new information, new technology, new terminology … But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us for ever, like a touchstone.

“All kinds of things are happening to me,” I begin. “Some I chose, some I didn’t. I don’t know how to tell one from the other any more. What I mean is, it feels like everything’s been decided in advance – that I’m following a path somebody else has already mapped out for me. It doesn’t matter how much I think things over, how much effort I put into it. In fact, the harder I try, the more I lose my sense of who I am. It’s as if my identity’s an orbit that I’ve strayed far away from, and that really hurts. But more than that, it scares me. Just thinking about it makes me flinch.”

Between 1977 and 2014 the share of national income going to the top 1 percent before taxes and benefits had risen by 88.8 percent. After fiscal redistribution their share increased by 81.4 percent. Nor did the tax and welfare state prevent the share of the bottom 50 percent from declining from 25.6 to 19.4 percent.25 Nor was this by accident.

“What do the pre- and postcrisis consensuses have in common?” Krugman asked in December 2013.32 “Both were economically destructive: Deregulation helped make the crisis possible, and the premature turn to fiscal austerity has done more than anything else to hobble recovery. Both consensuses, however, corresponded to the interests and prejudices of an economic elite whose political influence had surged along with its wealth …. Some pundits [might wish to] depoliticize our economic discourse, to make it technocratic and nonpartisan. But that’s a pipe dream. Even on what may look like purely technocratic issues, class and inequality end up shaping—and distorting—the debate.” This from a Nobel Prize–winning economist who in the 1980s and 1990s had counted squarely in the mainstream.

We have various words for this—panic, crisis, freeze, implosion, run, sudden arrest, sudden stop, radical uncertainty—and all these descriptions of what has happened or has threatened to happen to the global financial system since 2007 point to one thing: the fact that on top of the structural, slow-moving tensions that global integration may generate, it also produces sudden ruptures, events that cannot be fully accounted for or reduced to structural terms, or regulated by law. These crises are hard to predict or define in advance. They are not anticipated and often deeply complex. And they are urgent. Such moments demand counteracting intervention. They demand action. It is this juxtaposition that frames the narrative of this book: large organizations, structures and processes on the one hand; decision, debate, argument and action on the other.

The HIPC program has received much criticism for its slow pace in reducing the debt of poor nations. Our criticism of HIPC is the opposite. These programs are actually too eager to forgive debt. Debt forgiveness simply allows autocratic leaders to start borrowing more money. As we’ll see a little later, financial crises are one of the important reasons leaders are compelled to democratize. Debt reduction, however, relieves financial pressure and enables autocrats to stay in office without reform, continuing to make the lives of their subjects miserable.

We also ought to comment a bit on how not to improve corporate governance. In the wake of Enron’s collapse and other big frauds, Congress decided to regulate corporate governance, ostensibly to make it better. By now every reader knows that the interest of government leaders is not in making shareholders or even the man or woman on the street better off. Their interest is in making themselves better off.

Those factors are indeed relevant, as is implied in the analysis so far; but omissions from the list of what bourgeois scholars think relevant are really overwhelming. No mention is made of the exploitation of the majority which underlay all development prior to socialism. No mention is made of the social relations of production or of classes. No mention is made of the way that the factors and relations of production combine to form a distinctive system or mode of production, varying from one historical epoch to another. No mention is made of imperialism as a logical phase of capitalism.

Scholars often distinguish between groups in Africa which had states and those which were “stateless.” Sometimes, the word “stateless” is carelessly or even abusively used, but it does describe those peoples who had no machinery of government coercion and no concept of a political unit wider than the family or the village. After all, if there is no class stratification in a society, it follows that there is no state, because the state arose as an instrument to be used by a particular class to control the rest of society in its own interests. Generally speaking, one can consider the stateless societies as among the older forms of socio-political organization in Africa, while the large states represented an evolution away from communalism—sometimes to the point of feudalism.

Many guilty consciences have been created by the slave trade. Europeans know that they carried on the slave trade, and Africans are aware that the trade would have been impossible if certain Africans did not cooperate with the slave ships. To ease their guilty consciences, Europeans try to throw the major responsibility for the slave trade on to the Africans. One European author of a book on the slave trade (appropriately entitled Sins of Our Fathers) explained how many other white people urged him to state that the trade was the responsibility of African chiefs, and that Europeans merely turned up to buy the captives—as though without European demand there would have been captives sitting on the beach by the millions! Issues such as those are not the principal concern of this study, but they can be correctly approached only after understanding that Europe became the center of a world-wide system and that it was European capitalism which set slavery and the Atlantic slave trade it motion.

The most spectacular feature in Europe which was connected with African trade was the rise of seaport towns—notably, Bristol, Liverpool, Nantes, Bordeaux, and Seville. Directly or indirectly connected to those ports, there often emerged the manufacturing centers which gave rise to the Industrial Revolution. In England, it was the county of Lancashire which was the first center of the Industrial Revolution, and the economic advance in Lancashire depended first of all on the growth of the port of Liverpool through slave trading.

The connections between slavery and capitalism in the growth of England is adequately documented by Eric Williams in his well-known book Capitalism and Slavery. Williams gives a clear picture of the numerous benefits which England derived from trading and exploiting slaves, and he identified by name several of the personalities and capitalist firms who were the beneficiaries. Outstanding examples are provided in the persons of David and Alexander Barclay, who were engaging in slave trade in 1756 and who later used the loot to set up Barclays Bank. There was a similar progression in the case of Lloyds—from being a small London coffee house to being one of the world’s largest banking and insurance houses, after dipping into profits from slave trade and slavery. Then there was James Watt, expressing eternal gratitude to the West Indian slave owners who directly financed his famous steam engine, and took it from the drawing board to the factory.

It would be much too sweeping a statement to say that all racial and color prejudice in Europe derived from the enslavement of Africans and the exploitation of non-white peoples in the early centuries of international trade. There was also anti-Semitism at an even earlier date inside Europe and there is always an element of suspicion and incomprehension when peoples of different cultures come together. However, it can be affirmed without reservations that the white racism which came to pervade the world was an integral part of the capitalist mode of production. Nor was it merely a question of how the individual white person treated a black person. The racism of Europe was a set of generalizations and assumptions, which had no scientific basis, but were rationalized in every sphere from theology to biology.

The element of subordination and dependence is crucial to an understanding of African underdevelopment today, and its roots lie far back in the era of international trade. It is also worth noting that there is a type of false or pseudo integration which is a camouflage for dependence. In contemporary times, it takes the form of free-trade areas in the formerly colonized sections of the world. Those free-trade areas are made to order for the penetration of multinational corporations.

One of the most striking features of nineteenth-century West African history is the manner in which Africans returned from slavery under European masters and helped in the establishment of colonial rule. This was especially true of Africans who returned from the West Indies and North America to Sierra Leone or who were released from slave ships and landed in Sierra Leone. To a lesser extent, it also applied to Africans who were once in Brazil. Such individuals had assimilated capitalist values, and like most European missionaries, promoted the kinds of activity that went along with colonial rule. In a rather different context, it can be argued that the Arabs of Zanzibar and the East African coast were also transformed into agents of European colonialism. At first, they resisted because European colonialism affected their own expansionist ambitions on the East African mainland, but they soon came to an arrangement which gave Europeans the ultimate powers. The Europeans reduced the small Arab clique into political and economic instruments of imperialism.

In addition to private companies, the colonial state also engaged directly in the economic exploitation and impoverishment of Africa. The equivalent of the colonial office in each colonizing country worked hand in hand with their governors in Africa to carry out a number of functions, the principal ones being as follows: (1) To protect national interests against competition from other capitalists. (2) To arbitrate the conflicts between their own capitalists. (3) To guarantee optimum conditions under which private companies could exploit Africans. The last-mentioned objective was the most crucial. That is why colonial governments were repeatedly speaking about “the maintenance of law and order,” by which they meant the maintenance of conditions most favorable to the expansion of capitalism and the plunder of Africa. This led the colonial governments to impose taxes.

Fascism is a deformity of capitalism. It heightens the imperialist tendency towards domination which is inherent in capitalism, and it safeguards the principle of private property. At the same time, fascism immeasurably strengthens the institutional racism already bred by capitalism, whether it be against Jews (as in Hitler’s case) or against African peoples (as in the ideology of Portugal’s Salazar and the leaders of South Africa). Fascism reverses the political gains of the bourgeois democratic system such as free elections, equality before the law, and parliaments; it also extolls authoritarianism and the reactionary union of the church with the state. In Portugal and Spain, it was the Catholic church—in South Africa, it was the Dutch Reformed church.

The so-called development funds for Africa went almost exclusively into the building of economic infrastructures and into the provision of certain social services. Of the CD&W grants between 1946 and 1956, less than 1 percent was allocated to industries. In the case of FIDES from 1949 to 1953, the corresponding figure was less than 0.5 percent. Agriculture fared very little better, although that was of course the principal activity in which Africans were engaged. The colonial administration of Nigeria set up a Ten Year Plan, with hopes of borrowing heavily from CD&W funds. In that plan, the sum of 1,824 million pounds was voted for agriculture out of a total of 53 million pounds. Most of that agricultural grant was to be consumed by constructing an agricultural school and for providing salaries for British “experts.”

It has been observed that one hour of work of a cotton peasant in Chad was equivalent to less than one centimeter of cotton cloth, and he needed to work fifty days to earn what was needed to buy three meters of the cloth made from his own cotton in France. Yet, the French textile worker (using modern spindles) ran off three meters of cloth in a matter of minutes! Assuming that the Frenchman was not closer to God (who made the whole world in only six days and rested on the seventh), then there must be factors in the capitalist colonialist system, which permitted the great disparity in the relative value of labor in Chad and France. In the first place, the Chad peasant was defrauded through trade so that he sold cheap and bought dear, and therefore received a minute proportion of the value that he created with his labor. This was possible not because of mysterious “market forces,” as bourgeois economists would like us to believe, but because of political power being vested entirely in the hands of the colonialists. It was a consequence of monopolistic domination, both economically and politically. Secondly, the quantity of time spent by the Chad peasant was longer because colonialism did not permit him to acquire the tools to shorten the hours required to produce a given quantity of raw cotton.

In the educational sphere, the Belgians carried out a language policy which might appeal to contemporary nationalists, for they insisted that primary education should be in one of the five main African languages of the territory. However, in practice, they used that apparently progressive decision to seal off one Congolese ethnic group from another and to cut the educated off from a wider world of knowledge, because the missionaries translated into the local languages only that which they thought desirable. The policy of mock respect for African culture reached its highest expression in South Africa in the notorious Bantu Education Act of 1953, which sought to promote the differences between Zulu, Sotho, Xhosa, Venda, and so on—differences which were part of an early stage of development and which would have been transcended if there were no European intervention, or if under white rule, specific steps were not taken to maintain the anachronistic “tribal” entities.

In Morocco, the Muslim schools that were established by popular effort possessed the unusual feature of aiming at women’s emancipation by having a high percentage of girls—far higher than government schools. The French colonial administration deliberately kept mention of such schools out of their official reports, and they tried to keep their existence hidden from visitors. Another striking example of African self-help with regard to education was the project sponsored by the Graduates’ General Congress in Sudan. Founded by students, merchants, and civil servants in 1937, the Graduates’ Congress embarked on a program of school building. Within four years, a hundred schools were opened with the help of voluntary contributions. A smaller but equally exciting experiment was that of the Bugabo United Schoolboys Association, founded by two schoolboys in Mwanza, Tanganyika, in 1947. It was aimed at adult education and, in a short time, attracted over a thousand people of all ages. The organizers set up a camp where they housed and fed those who turned up while imparting to them the rudiments of literacy.

Where we went wrong is when we followed blindly the assumptions handed down to us by our exploiters. These assumptions can be stated briefly as follows: Growth in underdeveloped countries is hampered by inadequate growth in exports and inadequate financial resources and is made worse by “population explosion” in these countries. And the solution is prescribed as follows: Step up exports, increase aid and loans from the developed countries, and arrest growth in population. Throughout the last decade, our efforts have been to follow religiously the above prescription, and even if our own experience continues to disprove it, we still adhere to it even more fanatically! The greatest need appears to be a process of mental decolonization, since neither common sense nor sound economics, nor even our own experience, is with us in this.

This is what farming is like, for instance: all-hands-on-deck mobilization around planting and harvest, but otherwise, whole seasons taken up largely by minding and mending things, minor projects, and puttering around. But even daily tasks, or projects such as building a house or preparing for a feast, tend to take roughly this form. In other words, the traditional student’s pattern of lackadaisical study leading up to intense cramming before exams and then slacking off again—I like to refer to it as “punctuated hysteria”—is typical of how human beings have always tended to go about necessary tasks if no one forces them to act otherwise.13 Some students may engage in cartoonishly exaggerated versions of this pattern.14 But good students figure out how to get the pace roughly right. Not only is it what humans will do if left to their own devices, but there is no reason to believe that forcing them to act otherwise is likely to cause greater efficiency or productivity.

Human beings have long been acquainted with the notion of absolute, or sidereal, time by observing the heavens, where celestial events happen with exact and predictable regularity. But the skies are typically treated as the domain of perfection. Priests or monks might organize their lives around celestial time, but life on earth was typically assumed to be messier. Below the heavens, there is no absolute yardstick to apply.

Puritan, Methodist, and evangelical preachers soon began instructing their flocks about the “husbandry of time,” proposing that the careful budgeting of time was the essence of morality. Factories began employing time clocks; workers came to be expected to punch the clock upon entering and leaving; charity schools designed to teach the poor discipline and punctuality gave way to public school systems where students of all social classes were made to get up and march from room to room each hour at the sound of a bell, an arrangement self-consciously designed to train children for future lives of paid factory labor.25

The light shines into the act of life for only the briefest moment – perhaps only a matter of seconds. Once it is gone and one has failed to grasp its offered revelation, there is no second chance. One may have to live the rest of one’s life in hopeless depths of loneliness and remorse. In that twilight world, one can no longer look forward to anything. All that such a person holds in his hands is the withered corpse of what should have been.

“I don’t think in ideological terms. I never have,” Obama said, continuing on the health care theme. “Everybody who supports single-payer health care says, ‘Look at all this money we would be saving from insurance and paperwork.’ That represents one million, two million, three million jobs [filled by] people who are working at Blue Cross Blue Shield or Kaiser or other places. What are we doing with them? Where are we employing them?”9 I would encourage the reader to reflect on this passage because it might be considered a smoking gun. What is the president saying here? He acknowledges that millions of jobs in medical insurance companies like Kaiser or Blue Cross are unnecessary. He even acknowledges that a socialized health system would be more efficient than the current market-based system, since it would reduce unnecessary paperwork and reduplication of effort by dozens of competing private firms. But he’s also saying it would be undesirable for that very reason. One motive, he insists, for maintaining the existing market-based system is precisely its inefficiency, since it is better to maintain those millions of basically useless office jobs than to cast about trying to find something else for the paper pushers to do.10

The moral of the story is that when a profit-seeking enterprise is in the business of distributing a very large sum of money, the most profitable thing for it to do is to be as inefficient as possible. Of course, this is basically what the entire FIRE sector does: it creates money (by making loans) and then moves it around in often extremely complicated ways, extracting another small cut with every transaction.

It’s almost impossible to get accurate figures about exactly what proportion of a typical family’s income in, say, America, or Denmark, or Japan, is extracted each month by the FIRE sector, but there is every reason to believe it is not only a very substantial chunk but also is now a distinctly greater chunk of total profits than those the corporate sector derives directly from making or selling goods and services in those same countries. Even those firms we see as the very heart of the old industrial order—General Motors and General Electric in America, for example—now derive all, or almost all, of their profits from their own financial divisions. GM, for example, makes its money not from selling cars but rather from interest collected on auto loans.

Capitalism is not a single totalizing system that shapes and embraces every aspect of our existence. It’s not even clear it makes sense to speak of “capitalism” at all (Marx, for instance, never really did), implying as it does that “capitalism” is a set of abstract ideas that have somehow come to take material form in factories and offices. The world is more complicated and messy than that. Historically, the factories and offices emerged first, long before anyone knew quite what to call them, and to this day, they operate on multiple contradictory logics and purposes. Similarly, value itself is a constant political argument. No one is ever quite sure what it is.

Similarly, there’s a reason why those who work in the financial sector, and who have extremely well-paid occupations more generally, almost never go on strike. As Rutger Bergman likes to point out, in 1970 there was a six-month bank strike in Ireland; rather than the economy grinding to a halt as the organizers had anticipated, most people simply continued to write checks, which began to circulate as a form of currency, but otherwise carried on much as they had before. Two years before, when garbage collectors had gone on strike for a mere ten days in New York, the city caved in to their demands because it had become uninhabitable.

In a 2017 paper, US economists Benjamin B. Lockwood, Charles G. Nathanson, and E. Glen Weyl combed through the existing literature on the “externalities” (social costs) and “spillover effects” (social benefits) associated with a variety of highly paid professions, to see if it were possible to calculate how much each adds to or subtracts from the economy overall. They concluded that while in some cases—notably anything associated with creative industries—the values involved were just too subjective to measure, in other cases, a rough approximation was possible. Their conclusion: the most socially valuable workers whose contributions could be calculated are medical researchers, who add $9 of overall value to society for every $1 they are paid. The least valuable were those who worked in the financial sector, who, on average, subtract a net $1.80 in value from society for every $1 of compensation. (And, of course, workers in the financial sector are often compensated extremely well.) Here was their overall breakdown:13 researchers +9 schoolteachers +1 engineers +.2 consultants and IT professionals 0 lawyers –.2 advertisers and marketing professionals –.3 managers –.8 financial sector –1.5

Adam Smith and David Ricardo, the founders of British economic science, had embraced the labor theory of value—as did many of the new industrialists, since it allowed them to distinguish themselves from the landed gentry, whom they represented as mere idle consumers—but the theory was almost instantly taken up by Socialists and labor organizers and turned against the industrialists themselves. Before long economists began seeking for alternatives on explicitly political grounds.

If someone had designed a work regime perfectly suited to maintaining the power of finance capital, it’s hard to see how they could have done a better job. Real, productive workers are relentlessly squeezed and exploited. The remainder are divided between a terrorized stratum of the, universally reviled, unemployed and a larger stratum who are basically paid to do nothing, in positions designed to make them identify with the perspectives and sensibilities of the ruling class (managers, administrators, etc.)—and particularly its financial avatars—but, at the same time, foster a simmering resentment against anyone whose work has clear and undeniable social value. —from “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs”

In a sense, those critics who claim we are not working a fifteen-hour week because we have chosen consumerism over leisure are not entirely off the mark. They just got the mechanisms wrong. We’re not working harder because we’re spending all our time manufacturing PlayStations and serving one another sushi. Industry is being increasingly robotized, and the real service sector remains flat at roughly 20 percent of overall employment. Instead, it is because we have invented a bizarre sadomasochistic dialectic whereby we feel that pain in the workplace is the only possible justification for our furtive consumer pleasures, and, at the same time, the fact that our jobs thus come to eat up more and more of our waking existence means that we do not have the luxury of—as Kathi Weeks has so concisely put it—“a life,” and that, in turn, means that furtive consumer pleasures are the only ones we have time to afford.

By juxtaposing the call to “support the troops” with condemnations of the “liberal elite” the Right is effectively calling out the Left as hypocrites. They’re saying, “Sixties campus radicals claimed they were trying to create a new society in which everyone could be happy idealists living in material prosperity, where under Communism the distinction between value and values would be annihilated and all would work for the common good—but all they really ended up doing was to guarantee any jobs which allow one to feel like one is doing that are set aside exclusively for their own spoiled children.” This has some very important implications for the nature of the societies we live in. One thing it suggests about capitalism more generally, is that societies based on greed, even that say that human beings are inherently selfish and greedy and that attempt to valorize this sort of behavior, don’t really believe it, and secretly dangle out the right to behave altruistically as a reward for playing along. Only those who can prove their mettle at selfishness are to be afforded the right to be selfless.

Since at least the Great Depression, we’ve been hearing warnings that automation was or was about to be throwing millions out of work—Keynes at the time coined the term “technological unemployment,” and many assumed the mass unemployment of the 1930s was just a sign of things to come—and while this might make it seem such claims have always been somewhat alarmist, what this book suggests is that the opposite was the case. They were entirely accurate. Automation did, in fact, lead to mass unemployment. We have simply stopped the gap by adding dummy jobs that are effectively made up. A combination of political pressure from both right and left, a deeply held popular feeling that paid employment alone can make one a full moral person, and finally, a fear on the part of the upper classes, already noted by George Orwell in 1933, of what the laboring masses might get up to if they had too much leisure on their hands, has ensured that whatever the underlying reality, when it comes to official unemployment figures in wealthy countries, the needle should never jump too far from the range of 3 to 8 percent. But if one eliminates bullshit jobs from the picture, and the real jobs that only exist to support them, one could say that the catastrophe predicted in the 1930s really did happen. Upward of 50 percent to 60 percent of the population has, in fact, been thrown out of work. Except of course, there’s absolutely no reason it should have been a catastrophe.

To exercise power over another, in a sort of open strategic game, where things could be reversed, that is not evil. That is part of love, passion, of sexual pleasure … It seems to me we must distinguish the relations of power as strategic games between liberties—strategic games that result from the fact that some people try to determine the conduct of others—and the states of domination, which are what we ordinarily call “power.”25

I think Foucault is circling around something here, and never quite gets to the promised land: a safe-word theory of social liberation. Because this would be the obvious solution. It’s not so much that certain games are fixed—some people like fixed games, for whatever reasons—but that sometimes, you can’t get out of them. The question then does indeed become: What would be the equivalent of saying “orange” to one’s boss? Or to an insufferable bureaucrat, obnoxious academic advisor, or abusive boyfriend? How do we create only games that we actually feel like playing, because we can opt out at any time? In the economic field, at least, the answer is obvious. All of the gratuitous sadism of workplace politics depends on one’s inability to say “I quit” and feel no economic consequences.

In both Italy in the 1920s and Germany in the 1930s, old industrial evils, thought to have passed permanently into history, re-emerged as the conditions of labor deteriorated precipitously. In the name of saving society from the Red Menace, unions and strikes were outlawed. Union property and farm cooperatives were confiscated and handed over to rich private owners. Minimum-wage laws, overtime pay, and factory safety regulations were abolished. Speedups became commonplace. Dismissals or imprisonment awaited those workers who complained about unsafe or inhumane work conditions. Workers toiled longer hours for less pay. The already modest wages were severely cut, in Germany by 25 to 40 percent, in Italy by 50 percent. In Italy, child labor was reintroduced

Both Mussolini and Hitler showed their gratitude to their big business patrons by privatizing many perfectly solvent state-owned steel mills, power plants, banks, and steamship companies. Both regimes dipped heavily into the public treasury to refloat or subsidize heavy industry. Agribusiness farming was expanded and heavily subsidized. Both states guaranteed a return on the capital invested by giant corporations while assuming most of the risks and losses on investments.

For this reason, mainstream writers feel free to treat fascism and communism as totalitarian twins. It is a case of reducing essence to form. The similarity in form is taken as reason enough to blur the vast difference in actual class content. Writers like A. James Gregor and William Ebenstein, countless Western political leaders, and others who supposedly are on the democratic Left, regularly lump fascism with communism. Thus, Noam Chomsky claims, “The rise of corporations was in fact a manifestation of the same phenomena that led to fascism and Bolshevism, which sprang out of the same totalitarian soil.”12 But in the Italy and Germany of that day, most workers and peasants made a firm distinction between fascism and communism, as did industrialists and bankers who supported fascism out of fear and hatred of communism, a judgment based largely on class realities.

What happened to the U.S. businesses that collaborated with fascism? The Rockefeller family’s Chase National Bank used its Paris office in Vichy France to help launder German money to facilitate Nazi international trade during the war, and did so with complete impunity.14 Corporations like DuPont, Ford, General Motors, and ITT owned factories in enemy countries that produced fuel, tanks, and planes that wreaked havoc on Allied forces.

We might recall that unforgettable moment when President George Bush—whose invasions of Panama and Iraq brought death and destruction to those nations and who presided over a U.S. military empire that is the single greatest purveyor of violence in the world—lectured revolutionary leader Nelson Mandela on the virtues of nonviolence, even going so far as to quote Martin Luther King, Jr., during Mandela’s visit to Washington, D.C. in June 1990. Mandela’s real sin in Bush’s eyes was that he was part of a revolutionary movement that engaged in armed struggle against a violently repressive apartheid regime in South Africa. Bush’s capacity for selective perception had all the unexamined audacity of a dominant ideology that condemns only those who act against an unjust status quo, not those who use violence to preserve it. It would have come as a great relief to people around the world if the president of the United States had adopted a policy of nonviolence for his own government. In fact, he had done no such thing.

According to them, instead of getting worked up over the fact that almost all the world’s capital is concentrated in the hands of a few people and thereby stoking envy-fuelled debate, we should focus our critique on poverty, not inequality.15 On this front, they argue, a little can go a long way. Even small investments can have a far greater impact than costly, complex and normatively controversial redistributive policies, for instance. While there is certainly some truth to this, the suggestion that poverty is the ‘real’ evil points to a problematic theoretical construct of (neo) liberalism: the idea that economics is essentially a function of individuals – and not, as economic sociology would have it, a matter of structures. Liberal economic theorists from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman regard economics as a function of autonomous households using capital to improve their financial situation. According to this tradition, combating poverty means improving the ‘market potential’ of households without capital through transfer payments and education aimed at enhancing people’s ‘marketability’. As such, the call to focus on poverty rather than inequality, which – not by chance – came into vogue with the dawn of the neoliberal age, assumes a classically liberal (political) economy that simply ignores structural factors such as asymmetrical capital ownership or the unequal distribution of advantages arising from economic systems or social circumstances.16

The higher up the wealth distribution pyramid you go, the higher the ratio of financial to material assets. This is all the more significant because the holder of a financial asset – the creditor – is entitled to interest and principal payments from the borrower. In other words, unlike material goods such as houses, cars, machinery, land and so on, all financial assets are also transfer relationships. Income from these relationships grows in size and proportion to total income the closer you get to the top of the pyramid.19

In point of fact, the growing financial assets of the few, which also constitute the growing debts of the many, reflect a restructuring of global capitalism in the second half of the twentieth and the early years of the twenty-first century. This restructuring began with the process of financialization: triggered by a relaxation of the rules governing the financial industry and the invention of innovative products, the financial system has, since the late 1970s, become an increasingly attractive place to accumulate capital. More and more capital income has been generated by investing in debt and less and less by investing in labour, industry and other sectors of the real economy.

Engels offers an apposite account of an uprising in Spain in 1872-73 in which anarchists seized power in municipalities across the country. At first, the situation looked promising. The king had abdicated and the bourgeois government could muster but a few thousand ill-trained troops. Yet this ragtag force prevailed because it faced a thoroughly parochialized rebellion. “Each town proclaimed itself as a sovereign canton and set up a revolutionary committee (junta),” Engels writes. “[E]ach town acted on its own, declaring that the important thing was not cooperation with other towns but separation from them, thus precluding any possibility of a combined attack [against bourgeois forces].” It was “the fragmentation and isolation of the revolutionary forces which enabled the government troops to smash one revolt after the other.”7

As I argued at the time, this was hardly a realistic view. Capitalism is not just an economic system but an entire social order. Once it takes hold, it is not voted out of existence by electing socialists or communists. They may occupy office but the wealth of the nation, the basic property relations, organic law, financial system, and debt structure, along with the national media, police power, and state institutions, have all been fundamentally restructured.

I would suggest that Marxism is not a science in the positivist sense, formulating hypotheses and testing for predictability, but more accurately a social science, one that shows us how to conceptualize systematically and systemically, moving from surface appearances to deeper, broader features, so better to understand both the specific and the general, and the relationship between the two.

To understand capitalism, one first has to strip away the appearances presented by its ideology. Unlike most bourgeois theorists, Marx realized that what capitalism claims to be and what it actually is are two different things. What is unique about capitalism is the systematic expropriation of labor for the sole purpose of accumulation. Capital annexes living labor in order to accumulate more capital. The ultimate purpose of work is not to perform services for consumers or sustain life and society, but to make more and more money for the investor irrespective of the human and environmental costs.

Thus we fail to associate social problems with the socio-economic forces that create them and we learn to truncate our own critical thinking. Imagine if we attempted something different; for example, if we tried to explain that wealth and poverty exist together not in accidental juxtaposition, but because wealth causes poverty, an inevitable outcome of economic exploitation both at home and abroad. How could such an analysis gain any exposure in the capitalist media or in mainstream political life?

Since the early 1980s, these restrictions have been dismantled in virtually all OECD countries.32 This liberalization process began in the US which, as the holder of the reserve currency – the gold dollar standard – had a determining influence on the (Western) global economy of the postwar period.33 Scholars have identified two causes of this process. Firstly, the Americans were facing a trade deficit in the 1960s, meaning that more dollars were flowing out of the country than were coming in.34 There were several reasons for this: the US had a worldwide military presence and operations to keep up, and the central banks of signatories to the Bretton Woods agreement were obliged to maintain dollar reserves in order to keep the ‘fixed’ dollar exchange rate stable (by buying and selling dollars). Furthermore, American direct investment, particularly in European companies, was growing much faster than investments flowing back into the country (European direct investment in the US was roughly a third as high).

the total annual income of an economy is made up of capital gains (rents, dividends, interest and profits) and earned income. The contribution of the latter to the total income is known as labour’s share. In the advanced economies, this share has undergone two marked trends: after World War II, its importance relative to return on capital increased for a time, but has been declining again since the early 1980s.57 That means that more and more money is going to capital owners, namely landlords, entrepreneurs and creditors, with less and less being paid for labour.

Corporate income came to depend less and less on labour, but was itself derived from the financial markets. Reducing these human capital costs became less harmful to a company’s market value the more its income hinged on the performance of its own financial investments. The growing share of revenue from financial investments and the corresponding drop in revenue generated directly from the sale of labour-based products such as cars or sportswear can be identified with a migration of bargaining power.

The growing share of revenue from financial investments and the corresponding drop in revenue generated directly from the sale of labour-based products such as cars or sportswear can be identified with a migration of bargaining power. The new ascendancy of financial investments meant that that power was now concentrated in the hands of the personnel responsible for such investments, or those who succeeded in taking credit for their success. Consequently, it was analysts and traders, and above all managers and CEOs, who were able to negotiate pay rises. Meanwhile, the bargaining power of those involved in making the product itself – the people beavering away in office cubicles or on assembly lines and shop floors – has declined.66

What makes modern capitalist economies economic practices is the fact that they are based on competing access to finite resources. In other words, they allow scarce resources to be turned into capital assets which can then be exchanged for other assets – a process that can be described as a mutual granting of access to property. In economic practices, access to scarce resources is governed by ownership rights: property begets capacity, or the power to act. What makes modern capitalist economies capitalist practices, on the other hand, is the fact that the resources in question are accessed for a specific purpose – namely to achieve returns and increase one’s own wealth – and that this wealth accumulation is embedded in appropriative complexes whereby the investor is systemically more likely to succeed than to fail.

Thankfully, we know considerably more about lending conditions in the real world, since we too live in an age of banking, and we too have seen the banks usher in a new kind of agency or capacity that allows the existence of capitalist practices which cannot at the same time, or at least not in any real sense, be deemed economic practices.

As such, banks can be said to form the infrastructure of capitalism for three reasons. Firstly, the money used to pay for things in a transactional economy consists of bank debt. Secondly, the lion’s share of transactions is organized and managed by the banking system. And thirdly (a point that is, alas, aired far too little), banks produce the means of payment (money) in the form of circulatable liabilities. Banks create new money by granting credit or buying assets: that is to say, they are capital producers.

The last attempt to establish a monetary system of this kind was the postwar Bretton Woods agreement, which introduced a further layer to the network of payment promises in the majority of Western countries. Under this system, the gold standard was expanded into a gold dollar standard. Only the US Federal Reserve Bank issued book money, which signified – at least formally – a promise of gold assets. From then on, the signatory states to this agreement produced their own, substanceless currencies based on fractional dollar reserves, and the private commercial banks in turn – through the extension of credit – created further book money which, although only a gold debt in the most abstract sense, was nevertheless a functioning credit-based currency. Due to a series of misfortunes, this network was dissolved in 1973 and replaced with the global money system that still exists today.

Nowadays, there is no longer a (systemically critical) gold deposit held by a particular central bank, but there are still ‘reserves’. I use the word in quotes because they are very different from the precious metal reserves of previous centuries. Today, central bank reserves consist of substanceless book entries just like those in a private bank account. Economists describe this as a ‘fiat money system’, meaning one in which all currency, including reserves, consists of nothing more than written bank debts. This development has changed capitalism more fundamentally than is generally acknowledged.

It is not the central banks who are the prime movers, by generating the funds necessary for reserves and thus enabling the private banks to operate: On the contrary, the latter are entirely independent of any central bank in their decision-making. This much was conceded by the Deutsche Bundesbank in its monthly report of April 2017, in a departure from previous assessments of its own importance: ‘It suffices to look at the creation of (book) money as a set of straightforward accounting entries to grasp that money and credit are created as the result of complex interactions between banks, non-banks and the central bank. And a bank’s ability to grant loans and create money has nothing to do with whether it already has excess reserves or deposits at its disposal.’17

Indeed, central banks – contrary to the assumptions of the distribution theory model – have been successfully meeting orders for new cash for decades.20 In order to understand the economic dynamic of our time, it is therefore crucial to recognize that the dependencies between private commercial banks and their central banks are the exact opposite of those assumed by the distributive model. The ability to pump more money into the economy through increased investment and spending depends not just on central banks ‘printing’ more of it, but also on the demand for, and sanctioning of, private bank debt. It is this debt that creates a demand for central bank money in the first place – a demand which is in practice invariably met.

In reality, most of the distributional effects we are currently witnessing are, to a substantial extent, brought about neither by ‘property-based rights of disposal’ (economic payments) nor by ‘democratic decision-making codes of the political sphere’ (political payments),13 but by keystrokes (para-economic payments).

Although their practices need not necessarily drift into illegality, most banks are, globally speaking, owned by actors who are, at the same time, owners of other companies. In this context, related lending is not uncommon.34 To anyone working on the assumption that these loans to ‘related’ companies and entrepreneurs are simply an instance of banks moving assets around, these processes will seem like curious logistical loops. In the case of Iceland, no capital was transferred from its owner to their bank and back again: Instead, capital was created for the owner of the bank. The privilege of producing purchasing power generates returns which can thus be appropriated directly by bank owners.

He said: “It is all useless, if the last landing place can only be the infernal city, and it is there that, in ever-narrowing circles, the current is drawing us.” And Polo said: “The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”

Now. Yes, you are in your room, calm; you open the book to page one, no, to the last page, first you want to see how long it is. It’s not too long, fortunately. Long novels written today are perhaps a contradiction: the dimension of time has been shattered, we cannot love or think except in fragments of time each of which goes off along its own trajectory and immediately disappears. We can rediscover the continuity of time only in the novels of that period when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded, a period that lasted no more than a hundred years.

I read in a book that the objectivity of thought can be expressed using the verb “to think” in the impersonal third person: saying not “I think” but “it thinks” as we say “it rains.” There is thought in the universe—this is the constant from which we must set out every time. Will I ever be able to say, “Today it writes,” just like “Today it rains,” “Today it is windy”? Only when it will come natural to me to use the verb “write” in the impersonal form will I be able to hope that through me is expressed something less limited than the personality of an individual. And for the verb “to read”? Will we be able to say, “Today it reads” as we say “Today it rains”? If you think about it, reading is a necessarily individual act, far more than writing. If we assume that writing manages to go beyond the limitations of the author, it will continue to have a meaning only when it is read by a single person and passes through his mental circuits. Only the ability to be read by a given individual proves that what is written shares in the power of writing, a power based on something that goes beyond the individual. The universe will express itself as long as somebody will be able to say, “I read, therefore it writes.” This is the special bliss that I see appear in the reader’s face, and which is denied me.

In 1983, American sociologist Albert Szymanski reviewed a variety of Western studies of Soviet income distribution and living standards. He found that the highest paid people in the Soviet Union were prominent artists, writers, professors, administrators, and scientists, who earned as high as 1,200 to 1,500 rubles a month. Leading government officials earned about 600 rubles a month; enterprise directors from 190 to 400 rubles a month; and workers about 150 rubles a month.

One of the most striking features of Lenin’s and Stalin’s approach to the national question was the considerable attention they devoted to it. Lenin read dozens of books in different languages on the history and problems of various national groups, prepared hundreds of pages of notes, and wrote at least twelve major speeches, reports, or sections of books on this question.30 Lenin made novel refinements in Marxist theory with regard to the importance of national liberation struggles and the right of nations to self-determination.31 Stalin, too, devoted considerable attention to the national question, on which he wrote numerous speeches and reports.32 Moreover, after the revolution, Stalin served as Commissar of Nationalities and dealt with numerous difficult national problems, on which he and Lenin occasionally disagreed.

Stalin went a long way toward the creation of a fair and viable multinational state, but his policies also had a problematic side. During World War II, in his determination to thwart narrow nationalism among the backward elements on the periphery, Stalin relocated entire populations, attacked Jews as “rootless cosmopolitans,” and gave Russians domination of the Party and state.36

From the mid-1930s to Stalin’s death in 1953, the policies of forced collectivization, rapid industrialization, and centralized planning through a series of five-year plans held complete sway. Certainly, the trial and execution of Bukharin and other leaders, and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of rank and file Communists, many of whom were innocent of any wrongdoing, had much to do with the comparative reticence of opposition voices. It would be wrong, however, to assume either that Stalin eliminated all diversity of thinking or that repression alone accounted for the dominance of Stalin’s views. The widespread acceptance of Stalin’s approach to building socialism resulted mainly from its obvious success in bringing the Soviet Union within a short period out of semi-feudal backwardness into the front ranks of the industrialized nations.

Bahman Azad gives a succinct summary of the accomplishments. In the first two five-year plans, industrial production grew at an average annual rate of 11 percent. From 1928 to 1940, the industrial sector grew from 28 percent to 45 percent of the economy. Between 1928 and 1937, heavy manufacturing output’s share of total manufacturing output grew from 31 percent to 63 percent. The illiteracy rate dropped from 56 percent to 20 percent. The number of graduates from high school, specialized schools and universities jumped. Moreover, in this period, the state began providing free education, free health services, and social insurance, and after 1936 the state gave subsidies to single mothers and to mothers with many children. These accomplishments, Azad notes, were “impressive and historically unprecedented.”37

First, Khrushchev’s treatment of Stalin was exaggerated, one-sided, and incomplete. Secondly, the denunciation of Stalin served politically factional ends. Much could be said about the distortions of Khrushchev’s treatment of Stalin. For example, Khrushchev implied that Stalin emerged suddenly on the scene in 1924, when in truth Stalin had solid revolutionary credentials dating from his political work among railroad workers in Georgia in 1898. Khrushchev quoted Lenin’s so-called last testament criticizing Stalin’s rudeness but ignored Lenin’s praise of Stalin as an outstanding leader. In 1956, Khrushchev concentrated on Stalin’s alleged repression of Party leaders and claimed that half of the delegates to the Seventeenth Party Congress and 70 percent of the Central Committee were killed. Stalin’s biographer, Ken Cameron, concluded that it is “difficult to believe that Khrushchev’s figures are correct.”63 (Using the recently opened Soviet archives, scholars have numbered the total of executions from 1921 to 1953 at 799,455, far below the millions estimated by Robert Conquest, Roy Medvedev and other anti-Soviet scholars.64) Also, Khrushchev ignored the evidence of sabotage that served as the ostensible reason for the repression

On international relations, Khrushchev stressed the policy of peaceful coexistence. He argued that, with the growth of the socialist world, the balance of forces had so shifted that the main struggle consisted of “peaceful competition” between socialism and capitalism and that a “peaceful transition” from capitalism to socialism was possible. Even though these ideas became the centerpiece of the Chinese denunciation of Khrushchev as a revisionist,81 several things could be said in their defense. First, these ideas appeared at the height of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union was encircled by a vastly stronger United States that was justifying a bellicose anti-Soviet and anti-revolutionary foreign policy by claiming that an inherently expansionist Soviet Union was bent on worldwide aggression and subversion. In this context, Khrushchev’s ideas forcefully rejoined imperialism’s claims. They undercut the forces pushing for war against the Soviet Union and strengthened the international peace movement. Second, Khrushchev’s ideas on this matter did not break new ground entirely. In a series of interviews before he died, Stalin himself had emphasized the policy of peaceful coexistence and rejected the idea that war was inevitable.82 Thirdly, in practice, Khrushchev did not shrink from defending socialism abroad. He intervened against a counterrevolution in Hungary in 1956 and sent missiles to defend Cuba in 1962. Indeed, at the peak of the Cuban missile crisis, when the fate of the Cuban revolution hung in the balance, Khrushchev insisted on an American commitment not to invade the island before he withdrew Soviet missiles.83 Moreover, Khrushchev never shrank from extending generous material aid and technical assistance to those struggling to make their own way against imperialism, including China (before the break), Egypt, and India. Historian William Kirby called Soviet aid to China between 1953 and 1957, “the greatest transfer of technology in world history.” 84

Though much of the criticism made of Brezhnev was deserved, it obscured the simple truth that most of the problems the Soviet Union experienced under Brezhnev had their origins under Khrushchev. Moreover, though Brezhnev did little to reverse Stalin’s mistreatment of certain nationalities or to denounce earlier violations of socialist legality, he did reverse some of the more extreme of Khrushchev’s policies. Centralized planning returned. “Cadre stability” replaced term limits. A unitary party organization replaced the division into industrial and agricultural forms. Stricter Party admission standards replaced mass recruitment. The “state of all the people” and the “party of all the people” remained but acquired a different meaning.

In large measure, the economic gains were made possible by the concentrated investments in natural resources and heavy industry initiated by Stalin. Unquestionably, this growth was also aided by the availability of vast amounts of cheap natural resources, particularly oil, gas, coal, and iron ore. In the 1970s, however, both objective and subjective problems eroded economic performance. Three objective problems stood out: first, the relative exhaustion of natural resources, which made the extraction of gas, oil, and coal more expensive; second, the demographic consequences of World War II that had dramatically reduced the size of the workforce; three, the challenge of adopting new computer technology, particularly in the face of defective computer chips deliberately sold to the Soviet Union by the U.S.

It embraced a common practice in state stores of salespeople and managers laying aside rare goods in order to secure tips from favored customers or to sell them in the black market.

An indication of this benign neglect appeared in the almost complete absence of prosecution of clearly illegal economic activity. In the early 1980s, crimes of speculation (buying to resell at a higher price) accounted for only 2 percent of all reported crimes. According to one estimate, the actual amount of speculation was a hundred times greater.198 In retrospect, few other mistakes of the Soviet leadership did so much harm as the indifference toward illegal economic activity.

Alexander Gurov, a top police official in the USSR, related the development of Party corruption from the time of Khrushchev to Gorbachev directly to the development of illegal economy and organized crime: It [organized crime] was bound to happen as soon as our system opened up and that was in the so-called thaw of the 1960s when Nikita Khrushchev was in power….It was impossible to imagine powerful organized crime groups under Stalin…. What we got after that in our society was the moral code of the plunderer. And of course it was run totally in the interest of the [Party] bureaucracy. For example, we had a so-called trade mafia in Moscow with representatives in top Party bodies as early as 1974. If I or anyone else had tried to warn people about the danger of the shadow economy then, liberals would have laughed and the government would have called us crazy. But that was how it started. And the government allowed it to happen, for reasons that ought to make us think. It began under Khrushchev and developed under Brezhnev. But the Gorbachev era was the period in which organized crime really became powerful in our country.208

As Michael Ellman and Vladimir Kontorovich point out that discontent arose as a product, not a cause, of the reform. Personal consumption of Soviet citizens had increased between 1975 and 1985. Even though the Soviet standard of living reached only one-third to one-fifth of the American level, a general appreciation existed that Soviet citizens enjoyed greater security, lower crime, and a higher cultural and moral level than citizens in the West did. Moreover, empirical studies in the mid-1980s revealed that Soviet and American workers expressed about the same degree of satisfaction with their jobs. As late as 1990, only a small minority favored a transition to a capitalist system. Barely 4 percent of Soviet citizens favored the removal of price controls, and only 18 per cent favored the encouragement of private property.224

Andropov mentioned the quantity and quality of consumer goods, the shortage of certain foods, the waste of energy resources, the poor performance of transport, and the failure of iron and steel enterprises to meet their targets. What linked many of these problems for Andropov was the failure to employ the discoveries of science and technology. This failure was reflected in unsatisfactory progress in increasing productivity, intensifying production methods, and economizing material resources. These failures were in part traceable to a planning system that placed too much emphasis on the achievement of quantitative production goals. Since improving products and production methods could temporarily reduce or slow production, there was a built-in disincentive to innovate.

The United States was giving $8 million a year to the Polish opposition group, Solidarity, and supplying it with sophisticated communication equipment, computers, fax machines, printing equipment, and intelligence information. U.S. sanctions against Poland required the Soviet Union to send the country $1 to $2 billion a year in aid. Led by the efforts of CIA chief William Casey, the administration trained Afghans, sent them artillery and rockets, and induced the Egyptians, Saudis, and Chinese to send them aid.

At the end of 1985 and early 1986, Gorbachev also began a retreat from the Soviet commitment to Afghanistan, even though a complete capitulation was two years away. Soviet military involvement in Afghanistan began in 1979, after the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) that had seized power the previous year made repeated requests for Soviet help to repel attacks by CIA-backed warlords. While attempting to modernize one of the poorest and most backward lands on earth, the PDPA had redistributed land, promoted religious freedom, given greater freedom to women, and initiated a literacy campaign aimed at the 90 percent of the population that could not read. Almost immediately, the government had faced armed resistance from local warlords, who began a counterrevolution by assassinating the rural teachers of girls.319 The warlords soon gained money and arms from the CIA, whose aid predated and intentionally provoked the Soviet intervention. Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter’s National Security Advisor later said, “We knowingly increased the probability that they [the Soviets] would [intervene].”320 This CIA support eventually amounted to its largest covert operation since World War II.321 The Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko governments viewed the Soviet aid to Afghanistan as international solidarity against the “hand of imperialism.”322

After 1987 no person outside of Gorbachev had more influence than Alexander Yakovlev on Soviet policies, particularly on those that undermined the CPSU and empowered anti-Party and pro-capitalist intellectuals. By his own admission Yakovlev was a social democrat. So were other key Gorbachev advisers. Georgi Shakhnazarov had referred to himself as a social democrat since the 1960s. Archie Brown, a British analyst, described Anatoly Chernyaev as “a longstanding liberal political thinker.” Gorbachev introduced Chernyaev as my “alter ego” to Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a Social Democrat.352 According to D’Agostino, Chernyaev, Shakhnazarov, and Yakovlev did Gorbachev’s writing.

Instead, in 1987-88 Gorbachev came to view the CPSU as the main obstacle to perestroika, and he decided to use “radical political reform,” to weaken it. As part of the attack on the Party, Gorbachev initiated a “de-Stalinization” campaign. Twice, in early 1987 and 1988, Gorbachev and Yakovlev waged major campaigns to drive the media to revise Party history. Khrushchev had pioneered this practice against Party opponents in 1956 and in 1961.347 Gorbachev gave his approval to economic exposés claiming Soviet statistics had been systematically falsified to understate economic failure, and that “Stalinist” stagnation was at the root of the crisis, which, Gorbachev alleged, was far worse than people realized. Gorbachev used denunciations of Stalin to weaken Ligachev and his allies. In February 1987, Gorbachev decided to relax even more the restraints on the media and to allow the media to air criticisms of Stalin. This represented an about-face from his warning six months earlier against “digging up the past.”348 An attack on Stalin helped Gorbachev create a coalition against honest socialist forces. As historian Stephen Kotkin said, his coalition joined together “those who denounced Stalin in the name of reforming socialism and those who denounced him in the name of repudiating socialism.”349 Stephen F. Cohen said that anti-Stalinism became the “ideology of Communist reform from above, as it was under Khrushchev.”350

The notion that Andreyeva simply spouted neo-Stalinism or in the words of journalist Robert Kaiser, “fiercely defended Stalin,”377 represented a preposterous misreading. Andreyeva said she shared the “anger and indignation” of all Soviet people over the repression of the 1930s and 1940s, from which, she said, her own family had suffered. Moreover, she said the Party’s 1956 resolution on the cult of personality and Gorbachev’s speech on the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution remained “the scientific guidelines to this day.”

Other evidence for the nature and timing of his political conversion varied. Gorbachev’s own Memoirs, conflated early and later attitudes into a mess of contradictions. Fondness, pity, and disdain for the CPSU simultaneously filled the pages. Still, if he is to be believed, from the early days Gorbachev saw the CPSU as the main obstacle, and the Party apparatus as his main enemy, not as an instrument to carry the struggle for reform forward. He had to outmaneuver the Party, not struggle within it. He always appealed to intellectuals and the public over the Party’s head. Everywhere, his Memoirs contain such sentiments as “Party structures are applying the brakes.”409

According to an American scholar on the Afghan conflict, “The outcome of this war was ultimately determined at home in Moscow.”426 The withdrawal occurred with no agreement on Soviet demands for an end to U.S. military aid to the mujahadin, and no American guarantees for the safety of Afghan Communist leaders or for a non-aligned Afghanistan. On February 15, 1989 the last Soviet troops left, with nothing to show for their years of sacrifice.427 The Afghans were left to the mercy of murderous warlords first, and then to the Islamic fundamentalists of the Taliban, as all of the economic, political, and educational progress of the erstwhile revolutionary regime was destroyed.

Until December 1988, the USSR still largely supported the African National Congress (ANC) and other African freedom movements. In late 1988, however, came the first sign of a change in Soviet policy. The advancing liberation movements in Southwest Africa, aided by Cuba and the USSR, had compelled an election in Namibia whose fairness would be guaranteed by UN troops. Without consulting the liberation movement, the Southwest African People’s Organization (SWAPO), or its ally Cuba, Shevardnadze suddenly agreed to an American proposal to cut down the presence of UN troops in Namibia.428

Gorbachev abandoned the so-called “Brezhnev Doctrine,” which held that the Soviet Union and other Eastern European states had a right and a duty to defend socialism in any member state of the Warsaw Pact. This doctrine was consistent with Lenin’s classic writings that considerations of the class struggle take precedence over considerations of national sovereignty.429 The doctrine expressed a form of class solidarity extended to interstate relations, the solidarity of one socialist state with another. According to David Lane, “In 1989 it was made clear that the USSR would not intervene in the affairs of other states, even if members of the same alliance.”430 In Eastern Europe where Communist governments had always been less deeply rooted than in the USSR, Gorbachev’s policy of troop cutbacks and non-interference spelled disaster. In all Eastern European societies, the Communist governments rapidly lost self-confidence, and opposition elements took heart.

Ligachev and Ryzhkov argued for a cautious experimental plan in which the state would purchase 90 percent of industrial output, leaving only 10 percent of industry to face the uncertainties of supply and demand. The Ligachev-Ryzhkov plan would have gently pushed enterprises to experiment with autonomy and free prices. The Gorbachev plan proved utterly reckless. It plunged the economy into chaos.

Against the better judgment of Prime Minister Ryzhkov and Ligachev, Yakovlev and Gorbachev pushed to shrink the state orders—the guaranteed government purchase of Soviet industrial output at fixed prices—from 100 percent to a mere 50 percent of the whole of industry. Reducing state orders to such a degree meant that, in one leap, half of Soviet industry would gain autonomy to buy and sell its output in a new wholesale market-–trade between enterprises—with prices set by fluctuations in supply and demand.

Thus, the laws on Co-operatives and the law on Leases passed in 1988 contributed to the rapid expansion of the capitalist elements in the USSR. While slyly quoting Lenin —out of context—on the acceptability of co-operatives under socialism as a form of socialist property,440 the law actually allowed private property in the guise of a co-op. Soon the remaining state enterprises developed economic relationships with privately owned co-ops, which were less regulated and less taxed than the state sector. The leasing of industrial property to co-ops became a way of privatizing assets while maintaining the fiction of public ownership

The cause of the collapse of the East European socialist states is beyond the scope of this account of the Soviet collapse. Suffice it to say the East European states were weaker than the USSR. First, the Eastern European socialist states were newer and less firmly rooted than Soviet socialism. Second, in much of Eastern Europe, socialist change stemmed less from homegrown revolutionary movements than from the wartime advance of the Red Army. Soviet occupation enabled small Communist Parties decimated by Nazi repression to build postwar antifascist government coalitions that evolved into socialist regimes. Thus, in Eastern Europe, outside circumstances made revolution comparatively easy and peaceful, but also less thoroughgoing. Third, national and religious sentiment worked against many of the regimes. Where such countries as Roman Catholic Poland viewed Russia as the historic oppressor, an extra problem in winning legitimacy burdened socialism. Where Russia was a historic friend and ally, as in Eastern Orthodox Bulgaria and Serbia, socialism walked an easier path. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR) the aspiration for national reunification clashed with the task of building a separate socialist state, but in Yugoslavia, socialism merged with the will for national independence. (This helps explain why in the 1990s NATO had to work so hard to stamp out the unity and socialist character of the remnants of the Yugoslav Federation.) Fourth, some states, bordering the West, notably the GDR, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, felt the pressure of economic and ideological competition with richer capitalist neighbors that, unlike socialist states, drew wealth from the Third World and aid from the United States. Faced with such pressure, Poland and Hungary became heavily indebted to Western banks. In 1985 Hungary joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Fifth, the excessive repressions of the Stalin era created a reservoir of resentment in such countries as Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak Party suffered from strong revisionist currents that in 1968 became obvious. Finally, for decades, the West had pursued a policy of “differentiation,” to sow disunity in Eastern European socialism by bestowing rewards on such states as Romania, willing to distance itself from the USSR.

Democracy in the USSR could have been more advanced in 1985 than it actually was, but that is no reason to identify “lack of democracy” as the main cause of the end of the Soviet Union. Many observers have little understanding of the actual features of socialist democracy.617 If the word “democracy” means the empowerment of working people, then the Soviet Union had democratic features that surpassed any capitalist society. The Soviet state had a greater percentage of workers involved in the Party and government than was the case with parties and governments in capitalist countries. The extent of income equality,618 the extent of free education, health care and other social services, guarantees of employment, the early retirement age, the lack of inflation, the subsidies for housing, food, and other basics, and so forth, made it obvious that this was a society run in the interests of working people. The epic efforts to build socialist industry and agriculture and defend the country during World War II could not have occurred without active popular participation. Thirty-five million people were involved in the soviets.619

The custodial role that one third of the public assume banks play is something of an illusion. Similar confusion is found over the ownership of the money that we put into our bank accounts. The ICB/Cobden Centre poll found that 77 per cent of people believed that the money they deposited in banks legally belonged to them.4 In fact, the money that they deposited legally belongs to the bank. When a member of the public makes a deposit of £1,000 in the bank, the bank does not hold that money in a safe box with the customer’s name on it (or any digital equivalent). Whilst banks do have cash vaults, the cash they keep there is not customers’ money. Instead, the bank takes legal ownership of the cash deposited and records that they owe the customer £1,000. In the bank’s accounting, this is recorded as a liability of the bank to the customer. It is a liability because at some point in the future, it may have to be repaid.

Consequently, economists and policymakers following a simple textbook model of banking will assume that: Banks are merely intermediaries and have no real control over the money supply of the economy. Central banks can control the amount of money in the economy. There is no possibility that growth in the money supply can get out of control because it is mathematically limited by the reserve ratio and the amount of base money. Unfortunately this textbook model of banking is outdated and inaccurate and, as a result, these assumptions will be untrue.

In contrast, the anti-Bullionist (later ‘Banking’) school claimed that rising prices were a natural result of increased economic activity and trade, resulting in a natural increase in the price of gold and the demand for loans.84

Following WWII, a 20-year period of relative financial stability ensued in much of the Western world, with the Bretton Woods agreement providing a fixed exchange rate against the US dollar, which in turn was convertible into gold at a fixed price. The system lasted into the 1970s until, just like Britain in 1931, the USA found itself unable to live up to the promise to convert dollars into gold. European commentators accused the USA of abusing the system by simply creating too many dollars, with which US firms then bought European companies and assets. The French government responded by demanding the conversion of its dollar balances into gold. As with the British gold standard, it turned out that the promise to convert into gold worked only as long as it was not acted on. In response to the French ‘raid on Fort Knox’, US President Nixon cancelled the dollar convertibility into gold. By 1976 all the world’s major currencies were allowed to float freely against each other.

The oil crises of the 1970s and rapid inflation helped usher into power the free-market-oriented governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the UK and USA, respectively, who, influenced by neoclassical free-market economics, began to further dismantle state controls on bank credit, including interest-rate caps. UK Conservative finance ministers Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson oversaw the abolition of all controls over consumer credit together with the deregulation of housing finance in the ‘Big Bang’ reforms of 1986.109 Compulsory liquidity reserve ratios were gradually reduced from the 12.5 per cent set in 1971, until eventually they were made voluntary (Figure 8). The next credit boom ensued, resulting in banking problems by the end of the 1980s.

The Bank of England sells bank notes to commercial banks. They sell these notes at face value (a £10 note sells for £10), yet the cost of printing a £10 note is just a few pennies. The difference between the face value and cost of production gives the Bank of England a substantial profit. This profit from the creation of money is known as ‘seigniorage’, and is paid over to the Treasury, where it can be used to fund government spending or to reduce taxation. Between 2000 and 2009 this seigniorage amounted to nearly £18 billion.

Huber and Robertson16 suggest the interest charged on the issuance of money by banks can be viewed as a ‘money tax’, since the Government could issue non-interest bearing money directly in to the economy. They also argue that banks enjoy a form of additional ‘special profit’ because they don’t have to first borrow this money like other organisations. This ‘special profit’ can be thought of as equivalent to the central bank’s base rate over the course of the loan.

Central banks tell us that monetary policy is conducted mainly through interest rates. The official description is along the following lines: when the Bank of England believes that the economy is heating up it will raise interest rates to dampen economic activity. Conversely, if too little economic activity is taking place the Bank will lower the policy rate on the basis that, since interest rates are the driving force of economic activity, this will stimulate growth. This official narrative has been criticised, as there is very little empirical evidence to support it; interest rates tend to follow economic growth and are positively correlated with it.23, 24

When bad loans become too large as a proportion of total assets, own capital – that is, the net worth of the bank – can become negative. In this case, the bank has become insolvent. This is quite feasible, since capital is commonly less than 10 per cent of bank assets. This means that a mere 10 per cent fall in values of assets held by banks will wipe out most banks.

In other words, the Basel capital adequacy arrangements reinforce the pro-cyclicality of the banking system. At best, the delay before growth in earnings from new lending shows up as capital and will act as a ‘drag’ on balance sheet growth. The same applies the other way round: if banks become concerned about the economy and their balance sheets, they will be less keen to make loans that might default and reduce their capital adequacy. So the trouble is that the design of capital adequacy rules usually neglects the crucial fact that banks are the creators of the money supply. Requiring banks to raise more capital in the boom times won’t stop the boom. The boom is caused by increased bank credit, and some of the expansion in the money supply can be tapped by banks to fund higher capital ratios.3, 4

Historically the only effective method of controlling bank credit has been via direct credit controls. These work as follows: the central bank tells commercial banks that they can extend credit for transactions that are not part of GDP, such as financial asset transactions including lending to hedge funds, only by a certain absolute amount, expressed as a fraction of GDP; say 5 per cent. At times they may even entirely forbid credit for such purposes. Banks then have to focus more on creating credit for transactions that are part of GDP.

The first agreement on liquidity between the Bank of England and commercial banks occurred in 1947, when the privately owned Bank of England was nationalised. It involved a requirement to hold a minimum ratio of highly liquid assets, such as central bank reserves, cash or Treasury bills, to deposits of 32 per cent. This was lowered to 27 per cent 16 years later. The regime prevailed until 1971, when the Competition and Credit Control policy regime (CCC) introduced a minimum reserve ratio of 12.5 per cent. As we saw in Chapter 4, CCC led to a massive decline in liquidity reserve ratios (Figure 8, Chapter 4). After twice lowering the minimum requirement, the Bank of England finally abolished the compulsory reserve ratio regime with the cash ratio deposit regime in 1981, which did not directly require a minimum level of liquid assets.

Depending on the quality, quantities, and streams of interest accruing to them, the bank can make a judgment as to whether it will be profitable to hold a loan or set of loans or to sell them. Because banks ‘originate’ the loans in the first place – and larger investment banks in particular have huge teams of analysts spread across the world looking at the latest developments in financial markets – they are quite often in a better position to judge the quality of a loan or set of loans than the buyer of the securitised loans. This is referred to as an ‘asymmetry of information’; the seller has better information than the buyer.

In reality, the tail wags the dog: rather than the Bank of England determining how much credit banks can issue, one could argue that it is the banks that determine how much central bank reserves and cash the Bank of England must lend to them (Section 4.3). This follows on from the Bank’s acceptance of its position as lender of last resort, even though it has not fully played this role in the recent bank rescues, such as Northern Rock and RBS, since it passed on the cost of initial central bank money injections to the Government and hence to tax-payers. When a commercial bank requests additional central bank reserves or cash, the Bank of England is not in position to refuse. If it did, the payment system described above would rapidly collapse.22

The ubiquity of rationing also becomes obvious when we are trying to obtain tickets for the theatre, or, indeed, the Olympic Games. If, in aggregate, the amount supplied in a market is smaller than the amount demanded, the supply side is the short side and has market power. It could push up the price of the apples or gain other advantages and benefits and the buyers would have to put up with it. Market power is again often felt in the labour market, or in the allocation of orders to contractors, where the decision-makers often demand – and obtain – what could be described as ‘non-market’ benefits or ‘rents’. For example it is becoming increasingly necessary to be willing to work for no salary for an extended period in order to gain entry into some professions.34

Speaking to the Sunday Times (London), on August 31, 1989, a Polish journalist observed: "Since the war, this country has been run by a succession of different methods. First we had sheer Stalinist terror and then the mobilization of idealism which was gradually dissipated under Gomulka. When Gierek came to power, he tried a new formula – technocracy and consumerism. But he combined it with autocracy, and the mix simply did not work. Technocracy must be controlled and channelled by democracy.’ At that time, his account was accurate but it gave only a superficial explanation of the Polish situation. What the journalist failed to say was that the transition from one method of domination to another (the next) was made under pressure from workers’ uprisings, and that each "new system" was a response to these uprisings. Resumption of work was the authorities short-term goal; restoration of the complete domination of capital was the long-term goal. The authorities were forced to make economic and political concessions every time. And Although, over the years, they tried by various repressive means to reimpose the yoke of exploitation on the workers, they were not able to erase from the workers’ memories the fact that a mass movement had caused capitalist power to back down.

At that time the political class thought it wise to define what it called "the Polish road to socialism" Gomulka legalized workers councils only to gradually empty them of all content. Furthermore, he channelled part of the surplus value extorted from the workers (which was then assigned to basic industrial investments in heavy industry) into the production of consumer goods in an attempt to raise the standard of living. So here was a Communist Party, under pressure from the class struggle, recognizing workers’ interests and accepting their intervention in economic decisions, namely in the disposition of their labor. Another of the Party’s retreats had equally great consequences for later events: a numerous peasantry (more than 30% of the population) recovered their lands in the form of private property, Although with certain restrictions.

Progressive elimination of the peasant class in the transition to capitalist agriculture, industrial development with the proletarianization of the ex-peasants, transformation of the ruling class into a pro-managerial class – all this might have appeared as the "free and natural" development of the system. But the Russian domination, both strategic and economic, forced the retention of the Leninist model of Party domination, a Party claiming to centralize all decisions and to determine the rhythm of economic growth, which in a class society is absolutely impossible.

Everything was on strike: buses, bread and milk delivery, nursing, construction, water service; the meat would have to be distributed to the population. The government sent Jagielski, deputy Prime Minister; the Party issued an official summons to return to work. Everything ended two days later, but the fact remained that an entire city organized itself to go on strike; the demands did not remain merely economic. A desire to assure the gains already won led to an attempt to set up permanent organs of defence. Fifteen days later, following procedures they themselves set up, the Lublin railway workers began electing union representatives directly and other Lublin workers followed their lead.

Walesa tried to justify this edict by claiming that "70% of the demands were granted" (in fact, the agricultural union was recognized and a few over-zealous officials were transferred), but two victims of Bydgoszcz gave voice to the general dismay when they condemned Walesa’s betrayal of all their ideals: "Walesa has bungled. We can compromise on supplies of onions, but not over spilt blood."

The role of institutions such as the army and the Church was to guarantee the stability of Polish capitalism for the benefit of this capitalism itself, for the capitalist class and for the benefit of capital in its entirety (Western and Eastern branches). But these institutions also acted in their own interests; these interests were not, however, guaranteed within the system except when they coincided with the general interests of capital and with the specific interests of the various capitalist cliques. To the extent that the two imperialisms peaceably divide up the world, these institutions function to defend common interests.

To set oneself up as a direct political competitor of the ruling capitalist class is to ask for trouble, especially in the Polish context. The ruling clique’s response was all the more violent because the political call for Western-type democracy was not only incompatible with the structures imposed by the dominant Russian imperialism, but also because it inserted itself in the inter-imperialist rivalry. With the exception of Hungarian unions, all Eastern bloc countries avoided any contact with Solidarity.

On August 21, 1981, when Walesa tried to persuade the miners to work on Saturdays (in doing this, he was paving the way for Jaruzelski), workers at the Debienko mine responded by saying that they had organized themselves and that they could make their production quotas without working Saturdays. At the August 9 Warsaw demonstration organized by Solidarity to protest shortages, the union advocated giving flowers and fruits to the cops; the people gave them to striking workers. When the "responsible" demonstration was blocked by the cops, it quickly turned into a sort of "happening," a spontaneous street celebration.

On August 19, 1980, a Frankfurter Rundschau reporter observed: "The strikers do not want to abolish socialism, they want to finally achieve it." Thus, already in August 1980, the breach became apparent – the breach between the workers’ own movement and those who, in varying degrees, because they were “organized”, were immediately concerned about managing society’s – really capital’s – institutions with all the complications of Poland’s situation. In mid-August 1980, Kuron, leader of the organized opposition, expressed this: “The unfolding of events in Poland is beyond the control of the organized opposition. The extreme wage increases demanded by the strikers and granted by factory managers are not very sensible from an economic point of view. More and more it seems to me that the central leadership of the strike in Gdansk is under pressure from a militant rank-and-file.”

The Solidarity union in Lodz was the first one in Poland to energetically support the idea of worker self-management, starting in January 1981, and to advocate workers’ power in the enterprises. We supported the creation of regional committees to coordinate workers’ councils – they already existed in twenty-six regions-as well as the activities of the National Federation of Self-Management Bodies which was founded last October. Kowalewski described the government’s postponement of plans for economic reform at the end of 1981: The government’s decision caused agitation and extreme dissatisfaction in the factories: "We will have to institute the economic reforms ourselves, without the authorities and in spite of them, if necessary." This was the view more and more widely expressed by Lodz workers at enterprise meetings and by militants at regional discussions of the movement for self-management. This project ran into violent opposition from the government as well as hostility from a section of Solidarity’s National Committee.

Poland was not the worst defaulter on debts. (Debts in 1982 in billions of dollars: Brazil $88, Mexico $85, South Korea $39, Argentina $38, Poland $25.) Poland’s debt disturbed Western Europe more than it did the US; this explains the difference in response to the so-called economic sanctions. The concern of the lending banks was not so much the "bankruptcy" they cried so much about; a portion of their loans was guaranteed by their own governments or by special organizations. (In the US, for example, the government quickly repaid its banks the entire amount overdrawn by Poland.) Jaruzelski was a savior to banks, and in financial terms the West gained much more than Russia. The February 1, 1982 Financial Times stated explicitly: "The West is right to withhold trade credits and rescheduling of debts not as a punishment but because Poland in a state of profound political conflict is a much worse risk than a Poland which is, within limits, at peace with itself. Sooner or later that means reform."

My analysis also departs from Marx’s in its evaluation of the legacy and function of primitive accumulation. Though Marx was acutely aware of the murderous character of capitalist development - its history, he declared, "is written in the annals of humanity in characters of fire and blood" there can be no doubt that he viewed it as a necessary step in the process of human liberation. He believed that it disposed of small-scale property, and that it increased (to a degree unmatched by any other economic system) the productive capacity of labor, thus creating the material conditions for the liberation of humanity from scarcity and necessity. He also assumed that the violence that had presided over the earliest phases of capitalist expansion would recede with the maturing of capitalist relations, when the exploitation and disciplining of labor would be accomplished mostly through the workings of economic laws (Marx 1909 Vol. 1). In this, he was deeply mistaken. A return of the most violent aspects of primitive accumulation has accompanied every phase of capitalist globalization, including the present one, demonstrating that the continuous expulsion of farmers from the land, war and plunder on a world scale, and the degradation of women are necessary conditions

The most important historical question addressed by the book is how to account for the execution of hundreds of thousands of "witches" at the beginning of the modern era, and how to explain why the rise of capitalism was coeval with a war against women. Feminist scholars have developed a framework that throws much light on this question. It is generally agreed that the witch-hunt aimed at destroying the control that women had exercised over their reproductive function and served to pave the way for the development of a more oppressive patriarchal regime.

Caliban and the Witch shows that the body has been for women in capitalist society what the factory has been for male waged workers: the primary ground of their exploitation and resistance, as the female body has been appropriated by the state and men and forced to function as a means for the reproduction and accumulation of labor.

Indeed, the political lesson that we can learn from Caliban and the Witch is that capitalism, as a social-economic system, is necessarily committed to racism and sexism. For capitalism must justify and mystify the contradictions built into its social relations - the promise of freedom vs. the reality of widespread coercion, and the promise of prosperity vs. the reality of widespread penury - by denigrating the "nature" of those it exploits: women, colonial subjects, the descendants of African slaves, the immigrants displaced by globalization.

From the vantage point of this struggle, we can also see that capitalism was not the product of an evolutionary development bringing forth economic forces that were maturing in the womb of the old order. Capitalism was the response of the feudal lords, the patrician merchants, the bishops and popes, to a centuries-long social conflict that, in the end, shook their power, and truly gave "all the world a big jolt." Capitalism was the counter-revolution that destroyed the possibilities that had emerged from the anti-feudal struggle - possibilities which, if realized, might have spared us the immense destruction of lives and the natural environment that has marked the advance of capitalist relations worldwide. This much must be stressed, for the belief that capitalism "evolved" from feudalism and represents a higher form, of social life has not yet been dispelled.

Serfdom developed in Europe, between the 5th and 7th centuries A.D., in response to the breakdown of the slave system on which the economy of imperial Rome had been built. It was the result of two related phenomena. By the 4th century, in the Roman territories and the new Germanic states, the landlords had to grant the slaves the right to have a plot of land and a family of their own, in order to stem their revolts, and prevent their flight to the "bush" where maroon communities were forming at the margins of the empire. At the same time, the landlords began to subjugate the free peasants, who, ruined by the expansion of slave-labor and later the Germanic invasions, turned to the lords for protection, although at the cost of their independence.

If we also take into account that in medieval society collective relations prevailed over familial ones, and most of the tasks that female serfs performed (washing, spinning, harvesting, and tending to animals on the commons) were done in cooperation with other women, we then realize that the sexual division of labor, far from being a source of isolation, was a source of power and protection for women. It was the basis for an intense female sociality and solidarity that enabled women to stand up to men, despite the fact that the Church preached women's submission to men, and Canonic Law sanctified the husband's right to beat his wife.

This would explain why, when population growth became a major social concern, at a time of severe demographic crisis and labor shortage in the late 14th century, heresy became associated with reproductive crimes, especially "sodomy," infanticide, and abortion. This is not to suggest that the heretics' reproductive doctrines had a decisive demographic impact; but rather, that for at least two centuries, a political climate was created in Italy, France, and Germany, whereby any form of contraception (including "sodomy," i.e. anal sex) came to be associated with heresy. The threat which the sexual doctrines of the heretics posed for the orthodoxy must also be viewed in the context of the efforts which the Church made to establish its control over marriage and sexuality, which enabled it to place everyone — from the Emperor to the poorest peasant — under its scrutiny and disciplinary rule.

The Black Death destroyed one-third of the population of Europe. It was a turning point in European history, socially and politically. In all these cases, the rebels did not concern themselves with demanding some restrictions to feudal rule, nor did they only bargain for better living conditions.Their aim was to put an end to the power of the lords. As the English peasants declared during the Peasant Rising of 1381, "the old law must be abolished." Indeed, by the beginning of the 15th century, in England at least, serfdom or villeinage had almost completely disappeared, though the revolt had been politically and militarily defeated and its leaders brutually executed (Titow 1969: 58).

It is difficult retrospectively to tell how far playing the "sex card" helped the state to discipline and divide the medieval proletariat. What is certain is that this sexual "new deal" was part of a broader process which, in response to the intensification of social conflict, led to the centralization of the state, as the oily agent capable of confronting the generalization of the struggle and safeguarding the class relation. In this process, as we will see later in this work, the state became the ultimate manager of class relation, and the supervisor of the reproduction of labor-power — a function It has continued to perform today. In this capacity, state officers passed laws in many countries that set limits to the cost of labor (by fixing the maximum wage), forbid vagrancy (now harshly punished) (Getemek 1985: 61ff), and encouraged workers to reproduce.

"Transition," then, cannot evoke the changes that paved the way to the advent of capitalism and the forces shaped them. In this volume, therefore, I use the term primarily in a temporal sense while I refer to the social processes that characterized the "feudal reaction" and the development of capitalist relations with the Marxian concept of "primitive accumulation," though I agree with its critics that we must 5 rethink Marx's interpretation of it. Marx introduced the concept of "primitive accumulation" at the end of Capital Volume I to describe the social and economic restructuring that the European ruling class initiated in response to its accumulation crisis, and to establish (in polemics with Adam Smith) that: (i) capitalism could not have developed without a prior concentration of capital and labor; and that (ii) the divorcing of the workers from the means of production, not abstinence of the rich, is the source of capitalist wealth. Primitive accumulation, then, is useful concept, for it connects the "feudal reaction" with the development of a capitalist economy and it identifies the historical and logical conditions for the development of the capitalist system, "primitive" ("originary") indicating a precondition for the existence of capitalist relations as much as a specific event in time. Marx, however, analyzed primitive accumulation almost exclusively from the viewpoint of the waged industrial proletariat: the protagonist, in his view, of the revolutionary process of his time and the foundation for the future communist society. Thus, in his account, primitive accumulation consists essentially in the expropriation of the land from the European peasantry and the formation of the "free," independent worker, although he acknowledged that: The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, [of America], the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a preserve for the commercial hunting of black skins, are ... the chief moments of primitive accumulation ... (Marx 1909, Vol. I: 823). Marx also recognized that "[a] great deal of capital, which today appears in the United States without any certificate of birth, was yesterday in England the capitalised blood of children" (ibid.: 820-30). By contrast, we do not find in his work any mention of the profound transformations that capitalism introduced in the reproduction of labor-power and the social position of women. Nor does Marx's analysis of primitive accumulation mention the "Great Witch-Hunt" of the 16th and 17th centuries, although this state-sponsored terror campaign was central to the defeat of the European peasantry, facilitating its expulsion from the lands it once held in common.

Primitive accumulation, then, was not simply an accumulation and concentration of exploitable workers and capital. It was also an accumulation of differences and divisions within the working class, whereby hierarchies built upon gender, as well as "race" and age, became constitutive of class rule and the formation of the modern proletariat.

We cannot, therefore, identify capitalist accumulation with the liberation of the worker, female or male, as many Marxists (among others) have done, or see the advent of capitalism as a moment of historical progress. On the contrary, capitalism has created more brutal and insidious forms of enslavement, as it has planted into the body of the proletariat deep divisions that have served to intensify and conceal exploitation. It is in great part because of these imposed divisions — especially those between women and men — that capitalist accumulation continues to devastate life in every corner of the planet.

Not only did cooperation in agricultural labor die when land was privatized and individual labor contracts replaced collective ones; economic differences among the rural population deepened, as the number of poor squatters increased who had nothing left but a cot and a cow, and no choice but to go with "bended knee and cap in hand" to beg 30 for a job (Seccombe 1992). Social cohesion broke down; families disintegrated, the youth left the village to join the increasing number of vagabonds or itinerant workers — soon to become the social problem of the age — while the elderly were left behind to fend for themselves. Particularly disadvantaged were older women who, no longer supported by their children, fell onto the poor rolls or survived by borrowing, petty theft, and delayed payments .The outcome was a peasantry polarized not only by the deepening economic inequalities, but by a web of hatred and resentments that is well-documented in the records of the witch-hunt, which show that quarrels relating to requests for help, the trespassing of 31 animals, or unpaid rents were in the background of many accusations."

Indeed, the Europe that was preparing to become a Promethean worldmover, presumably taking humankind to new technological and cultural heights, was a place where people never had enough to eat. Food became an object of such intense desire that it was believed that the poor sold their souls to the devil to get their hands on it. Europe was also a place where, in times of bad harvests, country-folk fed upon acorns, wild roots, or the barks of trees, and multitudes roved the countryside weeping and wailing, "so hungry that they would devour the beans in the fields" (Le Roy Ladurie 1974); or they invaded the cities to benefit from grain distributions or to attack the houses and granaries of the rich who, in turn, rushed to get arms and shut the city gates to keep the starving out (Heller 1986:56-63).

That the transition to capitalism inaugurated a long period of starvation for workers in Europe — which plausibly ended because of the economic expansion produced by colonization — is also demonstrated by the fact that, while in the 14th and 15th centuries, the proletarian struggle had centered around the demand for "liberty" and less work, by the 16th and 17th, it was mostly spurred by hunger, taking the form of assaults on 45 bakeries and granaries, and of riots against the export of local crops.

In 1351, with the passing of the Statute of Laborers in England, which fixed the maximum wage, the state had formally taken charge of the regulation and repression of labor, which the local lords were no longer capable of guaranteeing. But it was with the introduction of public assistance that the state began to claim "ownership" of the work-force, and a capitalist "division of labor" was instituted within the ruling class, enabling employers to relinquish any responsibility for the reproduction of workers, in the certainty that the state would intervene, either with the carrot or with the stick, to address the inevitable crises.With this innovation, a leap occurred also in the management of social reproduction, resulting in the introduction of demographic recording (census-taking, the recording of mortality, natality, marriage rates) and the application of accounting to social relations.

Indeed, there is evidence that the wave of misogyny that by the late 15th century was mounting in the European cities — reflected in the male obsession with the "battle for the breeches" and with the character of the disobedient wife, pictured in the popular literature in the act of beating her husband or riding on his back — emanated also from this (self-defeating) attempt to drive women from the workplace and from the market.

On the other hand, it is clear that this attempt would not have succeeded if the authorities had not cooperated with it. But they obviously saw that it was in their interest to do so. For, in addition to pacifying the rebellious journeymen, the displacement of women from the crafts provided the necessary basis for their fixation in reproductive labor and their utilization as low-waged workers in cottage industry.

This was for women a historic defeat.With their expulsion from the crafts and the devaluation of reproductive labor poverty became feminized, and to enforce men's "primary appropriation" of women's labor, a new patriarchal order was constructed, reducing women to a double dependence: on employers and on men.The fact that unequal power relations between women and men existed even prior to the advent of capitalism, as did a discriminating sexual division of labor, does not detract from this assessment. For in pre-capitalist Europe women's subordination to men had been tempered by the fact that they had access to the commons and other communal assets, while in the new capitalist regime women themselves became the commons, as their work was defined as a natural resource, laying outside the sphere of market relations.

Throughout this first phase of proletarianization, it was the prostitute who often performed for male workers the function of a wife, cooking and washing for them in addition to serving them sexually. Moreover, the criminalization of prostitution, which punished the woman but hardly touched her male customers, strengthened male power. Any man could now destroy a woman simply by declaring that she was a prostitute, or by publicizing that she had given in to his sexual desires. Women would have to plead with men "not to take away their honor" (the only property left to them) (Cavallao and Cerutti 1980:346ff), the assumption being that their lives were now in the hands of men who (like feudal lords) could exercise over them a power of life and death.

Women could not have been totally devalued as workers and deprived of autonomy with respect to men without being subjected to an intense process of social degradation; and indeed, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, women lost ground in every area of social life. A key area of change in this respect was the law, where in this period we 71 can observe a steady erosion of women's rights. One of the main rights that women lost was the right to conduct economic activities alone, as femme soles.

Women were accused of being unreasonable, vain, wild, wasteful. Especially blamed was the female tongue, seen as an instrument of insubordination. But the main female villain was the disobedient wife, who, together with the "scold," the "witch," and the "whore" was the favorite target of dramatists, popular writers, and moralists. In this sense, Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew (1593) was the manifesto of the age.The punishment of female insubordination to patriarchal authority was called for and celebrated in countless misogynous plays and tracts.

It is now established that the plantation system fueled the Industrial Revolution, as argued by Eric Williams, who noted that hardly a brick in Liverpool and Bristol was not cemented with African blood (1944:61— 63). But capitalism may not even have taken off without Europe's "annexation of America," and the "blood and sweat" that for two centuries flowed to Europe from the plantations. This must be stressed, as it helps us realize how essential slavery has been for the history of capitalism, and why, periodically, but systematically, whenever the capitalist system is threatened a major economic crisis, the capitalist class has to launch a process of "primitive accumulation," that is, a process of large-scale colonization and enslavement, such as the one we are witnessing at present (Bales 1999).

In reality, like the Conquest, the slave trade was an epochal misfortune for European workers. As we have seen, slavery (like the witch-hunt) was a major ground of experimentation for methods of labor-control that were later imported into Europe. Slavery also affected the European workers' wages and legal status; for it cannot be a coincidence that only with the end of slavery did wages in Europe decisively increase and did European workers gain the right to organize. It is also hard to imagine that workers in Europe profited from the Conquest of America, at least in its initial phase. Let us remember that it was the intensity of the anti-feudal struggle that instigated the lesser nobility and the merchants to seek colonial expansion, and that the conquistadors came from the ranks of the most-hated enemies of the European working class. It is also important to remember that the Conquest provided the European ruling class with the silver and gold used to pay the mercenary armies that defeated the urban and rural revolts; and that, in the same years when Arawaks, Aztecs, and Incas were being subjugated, workers in Europe were being driven from their homes, branded like animals, and burnt as witches. We should not assume, then, that the European proletariat was always an accomplice to the plunder of the Americas, though individual proletarians undoubtedly were. The nobility expected so little cooperation from the "lower classes" that initially the Spaniards allowed only a few to embark. Only 8,000 Spaniards migrated legally to the Americas in the entire 16th century, the clergy making up 17% of the lot (Hamilton 1965:299; Williams 1986: 38-40). Even later, people were forbidden from settling overseas independently, because it was feared that they might collaborate with the local population.

This, however, was not an automatic process. Like sexism, racism had to be legislated and enforced. Among the most revealing prohibitions we must again count that marriage and sexual relations between blacks and whites were forbidden, white women who married black slaves were condemned, and the children resulting from such marriages were enslaved for life. Passed in Maryland and Virginia in the 1660s, these laws prove that a segregated, racist society was instituted from above, and that intimate relations between "blacks" and "whites" must have been very common, indeed, if life-enslavement was deemed necessary to terminate them.

Until the abolition of the slave trade, as Barbara Bush and Marietta Morrissey have documented, both women and men were subjected to the same degree of exploitation; the planters found it more profitable to work and "consume" slaves to death than to encourage their reproduction. Neither the sexual division of labor nor sexual hierarchies were thus pronounced. African men had no say concerning the destiny of their female companions and kin; as for women, far from being given special consideration, they were expected to work in the fields like men, especially when sugar and tobacco were in high demand, and they were subject to the same cruel punishments, even when pregnant (Bush 1990:42-44). Ironically then, it would seem that in slavery women "achieved" a rough equality with the men of their class (Momsen 1993). But their treatment was never the same. Women were given less to eat; unlike men, they were vulnerable to their masters' sexual assaults; and more cruel punishment were inflicted on them, for in addition to the physical agony women had to bear the sexual humiliation always attached to them and the damage done, when pregnant, to the fetuses they carried.

This point must be emphasized, given the tendency to attribute the leap capitalism brought about in die productivity of labor only to the specialization of work-tasks. In reality, the advantages which the capitalist class derived from the differentiation between agricultural and industrial labor and within industrial labor itself — celebrated in Adam Smith's ode to pin-making — pale when compared to those it derived from the degradation of women’s work and social position.

Marx, too, sees the alienation from the body as a distinguishing trait of the capitalist work-relation. By transforming labor into a commodity, capitalism causes workers to submit their activity to an external order over which they have no control and with which they cannot identify. Thus, the labor process becomes a ground of selfestrangement: the worker "only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working and when he is working is not at home" (Marx 1961:72).

The mechanisms of the persecution confirm that the witch-hunt was not a spontaneous process, "a movement from below to which the ruling and administrative classes were obliged to respond”(Lamer 1983:1). As Christina Lamer has shown in the case of Scotland, a witch-hunt required much official organization and administration." Before neighbor accused neighbor, or entire communities were seized by a "panic,” a steady indoctrination took place, with the authorities publicly expressing anxiety about the spreading of witches, and traveling from village to village in order to teach people how to recognize them, in some cases carrying with them lists with the names of suspected witches and threatening to punish those who hid them or came to their assistance (Lamer 1983:2).

In this "century of geniuses” — Bacon, Kepler, Galileo, Shakespeare, Pascal, Descartes — a century that saw the triumph of the Copernican Revolution, the birth of modern science, and the development of philosophical and scientific rationalism, witchcraft became one of the favorite subjects of debate for the European intellectual elites.

The intervention of the Basque fishermen against the persecution of their female relatives was a unique event. No other group or organization rose up in defense of the witches. We know, instead, that some men made a business of denouncing women, appointing themselves as "witch finders,” traveling from village to village threatening to expose women unless they paid up.

Thus, the role that the witch-hunt has played in the development of the bourgeois world, and specifically in the development of the capitalist discipline of sexuality, has been erased from our memory.Yet, we can trace back to this process some of the main taboos of our time. This is the case with homosexuality, which in several parts of Europe was still fully accepted during the Renaissance, but was weeded out in the course of the witch-hunt.

The question that remains is whether the rise of the modem scientific method can be considered the cause of the witch-hunt. This view has been argued most forcefully by Carolyn Merchant in The Death of Nature (1980) which roots the persecution of the witches in the paradigm shift the scientific revolution, and particularly the rise of Cartesian mechanistic philosophy, provoked. According to Merchant, this shift replaced an organic worldview that had looked at nature, women, and the earth as nurturing mothers, with a mechanical one that degraded them to the rank of "standing resources,” removing any ethical constraints to their exploitation (Merchant 1980:1275). The woman-as-witch, Merchant argues, was persecuted as the embodiment of the "wild side” of nature, of all that in nature seemed disorderly, uncontrollable, and thus antagonistic to the project undertaken by the new science. Merchant finds a proof of the connection between the persecution of the witches and the rise of modern science in the work of Francis Bacon, one of the reputed fathers of the new scientific method, showing that his concept of the scientific investigation of nature was modeled on the interrogation of the witches under torture, portraying nature as a woman to be conquered, unveiled, and raped (Merchant 1980:168-72).

A factor contributing to the end of the witch-hunt was the fact that the ruling class was beginning to lose control over it, coming under the fire of its own repressive machine, with denunciations targeting even its own members. Midelfort writes that in Germany: as the flames licked closer to the names of people who enjoyed high rank and power, the judges lost confidence in the confessions and the panic ceased... (Midelfort 1972:206).

When Columbus sailed to "Indies” the witch-hunt in Europe was not yet a mass phenomenon. Nevertheless, the use of devil-worship as a weapon to strike at political enemies and vilify entire populations (like Muslims and Jews) was already common among the elite. More than that, as Seymour Phillips writes, a "persecuting society” had developed within medieval Europe," fed by militarism and Christian intolerance, that looked at the "Other” as mainly an object of aggression (Phillips 1994).

Parinetto’s thesis is important since it helps us dispel the Eurocentrism that has characterized the study of the witch-hunt and can potentially answer some of the questions raised by the persecution of the European witches. But its main contribution is that it broadens our awareness of the global character of capitalist development and makes us realize that, by the 16th century, a ruling class had formed in Europe that was at all points involved — practically, politically, and ideologically — in the formation of a world proletariat, and therefore was continually operating with knowledge gathered on an international level in the elaboration of its models of domination.

But if we apply to the present the lessons of the past, we realize that the reappearance of witch-hunting in so many parts of the world in the '80s and '90s is a clear sign of a process of "primitive accumulation," which means that the privatization of land and other communal resources, mass impoverishment, plunder, and the sowing of divisions in once-cohesive communities are again on the world agenda. "If things continue this way” — the elders in a Senegalese village commented to an American anthropologist, expressing their fears for the future "our children will eat each other." And indeed this is what is accomplished by a witch-hunt, whether it is conducted from above, as a means to criminalize resistance to expropriation, or is conducted from below, as a means to appropriate diminishing resources, as seems to be the case in some parts of Africa today.

Everyone is female, and everyone hates it. If this is true, then gender is very simply the form this self-loathing takes in any given case. All gender is internalized misogyny. A female is one who has eaten the loathing of another, like an amoeba that got its nucleus by swallowing its neighbor. Or, to put a finer point on it: Gender is not just the misogynistic expectations a female internalizes but also the process of internalizing itself, the self’s gentle suicide in the name of someone else’s desires, someone else’s narcissism.

The claim that gender is socially constructed has rung hollow for decades not because it isn’t true, but because it’s wildly incomplete. Indeed, it is trivially true that a great number of things are socially constructed, from money to laws to genres of literature. What makes gender gender—the substance of gender, as it were—is the fact that it expresses, in every case, the desires of another. Gender has therefore a complementary relation to sexual orientation: If sexual orientation is basically the social expression of one’s own sexuality, then gender is basically a social expression of someone else’s sexuality. In the former case, one takes an object; in the latter case, one is an object. From the perspective of gender, then, we are all dumb blondes.

As far back as the fourteenth century, the word female was used to refer to women, with a particular emphasis on their childbearing capacity, but it arguably did not acquire the technical sense of “a human mammal of the female sex” until the rise of the biological disciplines in the nineteenth century. In the United States, the man known as the father of gynecology, J. Marion Sims, built the field in the antebellum South, operating on enslaved women in his backyard, often without anesthesia—or, of course, consent. As C. Riley Snorton has recently documented, the distinction between biological females and women as a social category, far from a neutral scientific observation, developed precisely in order for the captive black woman to be recognized as female—making Sims’s research applicable to his women patients in polite white society—without being granted the status of social and legal personhood. Sex was produced, in other words, precisely at the juncture where gender was denied. In this sense, a female has always been less than a person.

Luckily, Jon finds help, in the form of an emotionally fulfilling relationship with a wise older woman named Esther whom he meets at night school (Julianne Moore, obviously). After making slow, tender love to Esther on her couch, Jon mans up: he stops sleeping around, starts singing in traffic, mixes up his routine, stands up to his domineering father, and never watches porn again. In Don Jon’s concluding montage, Jon and Esther stare into each other’s eyes while Jon’s voiceover describes their new, “two-way” kind of love. “I do lose myself in her,” he confides, “I can tell she’s losing herself in me, and we’re just fucking lost together

However, what is much more interesting is that, beneath all these diverging opinions, there seems to be a shared perception that 1989 marks the end of the epoch which began in 1789 – the end of a certain ‘paradigm’, as we like to put it today: the paradigm of a revolutionary process that is focused on taking over state power and then using this power as a lever to accomplish global social transformation. Even the ‘postmodern’ Left (from Antonio Negri to John Holloway) emphasizes that a new revolution should break with this fetishization of state power as the ultimate prize and focus on the much deeper ‘molecular’ level of transforming daily practices. It is at this critical point that Wahnich’s book intervenes: its underlying premise is that this shift to ‘molecular’ activities outside the scope of state power is in itself a symptom of the Left’s crisis, an indication that today’s Left (in the developed countries) is not ready to confront the topic of violence in all its ambiguity – a topic which is usually obfuscated by the fetish of ‘Terror’.

Vengeance maintains the distinction between social groups and constructs their respective identities – here that of the sovereign people towards those who refuse them this sovereignty or do not respect it, those who are responsible for the denial of justice and the guilty who remain unpunished. If the order of penalty assumes that offender and offended belong to one and the same group, the order of vengeance ‘is inscribed in an intermediary social space between that in which the proximity of partners prohibits it and that in which their distance substitutes war for vengeance’.10 An approach of this kind undermines a supposed evolutionary opposition between vengeance and justice: vengeance is not a more archaic form of justice than penal justice, but a form of justice corresponding to a different social configuration. It is more a question of understanding vengeance as a moment of constitutive justice of the specific identity of each of the social groups that confront one another within the same society. It is at one and the same time a system of exchange and social control of violence . . . As an integral part of the overall social system, the system of retribution is above all an ethic that deploys an ensemble of representations and values relating to life and death, to time and space . . . it is finally an instrument and site of power identifying and opposing social units and vindicatory groups.11

It shows how, far from being disqualifying, this exhortation appeals to an ethic in which the disturbing question of duty appears. The demand for vengeance implies a reaction designed to obtain respect for the identity of the victim’s group: In this sense, the debt of the offence can be defined as a debt of life, and life as a spiritual and social capital that the members of the group are charged with defending and making fruitful . . . This life-capital is depicted by two symbols: blood, symbol of the union and continuity of generations, and honour, symbol of the identity and difference that makes it possible both to recognize the other and to demand that he respects you.12

Robespierre thereby redrew the camp of friends to be avenged, against the lack of differentiation produced by the sentiment of natural humanity and a concern for all victims outside any political consideration. Paraphrasing the Marseillaise, he pleaded for a sentiment of revolutionary humanity: Weep for the guilty victims assigned to the revenge of the laws, who fell under the sword of popular justice; but let your grief have an end, as with all human things. Keep some tears for more touching calamities. Weep for a hundred thousand patriots slain by tyranny, weep for our citizens dying under the fires of their roofs, and the sons of citizens murdered in the cradle or in the arms of their mothers. Do you not also have brothers, children and wives to avenge? The family of French legislators is the patrie; it is the entire human race apart from tyrants and their accomplices. Weep then for humanity dead under their hateful yoke. But console yourselves if, imposing silence on all common passions, you wish to ensure the happiness of your country and prepare that of the world, console yourselves if you wish to restore exiled equality and justice on earth, and to uproot by just laws the source of crimes and the misfortunes of your kind. A sensitivity that trembles almost exclusively for the enemies of liberty strikes me as suspect.31

Desmoulins introduced the plurality of political sensibilities – from the very fact of political work, and his experience of the world – as a plurality of conventions that were not all equivalent, but were nevertheless all capable of evolution, transformation and displacement. Robespierre rather hoped for a radical change in political sensibility on the part of his contemporaries.

On 10 March 1793, the Convention was on the point of dispersing without having established this tribunal, when Danton took the floor: What, citizens, can you leave without taking the great measures that public safety demand? I feel it is of utmost importance to take judicial measures that will punish the counter-revolutionaries, as it is for them that this tribunal must supplement the tribunal of popular vengeance . . . If it is so hard to convict for a political crime, is it not necessary that extraordinary laws, taken outside of the social body, should make rebels tremble and convict the guilty? Here public safety demands great means and terrible measures. I see no middle way between the ordinary forms and an extraordinary tribunal.7

The revolutionary Terror, which is attacked for its revolutionary tribunal, its law of suspects and its guillotine, was a process welded to a regime of popular sovereignty in which the object was to conquer tyranny or die for liberty. This Terror was willed by those who, having won sovereign power by dint of insurrection, refused to let this be destroyed by counter-revolutionary enemies. The Terror took place in an uncertain struggle waged by people who tried everything to deflect the fear felt towards the counter-revolutionary enemy into a terror imposed on it. This enemy, for its part, tried everything to bring the Revolution to an end. The greatest danger was then that of a weakening of the revolutionary desire – a discouragement, a corruption of the founding desire. It was this danger that haunted those actors most committed to the revolutionary process.

What then was the price of the Terror? The classic response is that the two months between 22 Prairial and 9 Thermidor year II saw 1,376 people perish on the scaffold.2 And brutal as the summary measures of the revolutionary tribunal then were, they were not the only price of the Terror or of the Revolution. This price also involved infringing the political border of the sacred. Fear, disgust, terror and enthusiasm were the emotions that signalled the experience of this border, the place where the Revolution and its actors might tumble into the void, where the violence inflicted on the body of the enemy was linked with a foundational vengeance and with popular sovereignty.

Benjamin criticized a ‘theorem’ that has become a virtual rule in the West, namely the sanctity of life, which they either apply to all animal and even vegetable life, or limit to human life. Their argument, exemplified in an extreme case by the revolutionary killing of the oppressor, runs as follows: ‘If I do not kill, I shall never establish the world dominion of justice . . . that is the argument of the intelligent terrorist . . . We, however, profess that higher even than the happiness and justice of existence stands existence itself.’6 For Benjamin, however, the proposition that existence stands higher than a just existence is false and ignominious, if existence is to mean nothing other than mere life . . . Man cannot, at any price, be said to coincide with the mere life in him, any more than it can be said to coincide with any other of his conditions and qualities, including even the uniqueness of his bodily person.

Rather than proposing an explanation for the decision in favour of terrorism, we should grasp in relief how this enabled those who never have access to public speech to take hold of this, to make known through it what is happening today on the side of those left out of account. If the French Revolution can help in analyzing such events, this is perhaps in the connection between the public speech of the voiceless, the ‘understanding nothing’ of this speech by those who make politics, and certain events of cruelty. The absence of public spaces in which popular speech could beat a path for itself, be heard and echoed in the form of pacifying laws, is partly linked with the upsurge of violence. When it is no longer possible to have insurrection recognized as such, violence can no longer be restrained and bloodshed is no longer unanimously reproved.

The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States.

Harris and Klebold’s psychology could be synthetically described as a suicidal form of the Neoliberal will to win. In the wake of the Neoliberal proclamation of the end of class struggle, the only social categories remaining are winner and loser. No more capitalists and workers; no more exploiters and exploited. Either you are strong and smart, or you deserve your misery. The establishment of capitalist absolutism is based on the mass adhesion (mostly unconscious) to the philosophy of natural selection. The mass murderer is someone who believes in the right of the fittest and the strongest to win in the social game, but he also knows or senses that he is not the fittest nor the strongest. So he opts for the only possible act of retaliation and self-assertion: to kill and be killed.

Nowadays, the bourgeoisie has disappeared. The financial deterritorialization is generating a post-bourgeois class, which has no relation to the territory and to community. It is a class that is not concerned with the future of any specific territorial community, because tomorrow it will move its business to a different part of the world. We might call it the ‘elsewhere class’, as it continuously displaces the stakes of its investment. But we may also call it a ‘virtual class’, for two reasons: because it is the class that gains profits from virtual activities, like net trading, and high tech immaterial production; and because it is the class that does not actually exist.

The role of Goldman Sachs as one of the principal architects of the crisis in Greece was particularly remarkable. As was revealed in 2010, not only they had helped the Greek government to conceal the true state of the country’s finances, but at the same time they had also bet against Greece’s sovereign debt, hoping for its default. As a consequence, in a matter of weeks millions of Greek people saw their livelihoods utterly disintegrate, while the country sank into a state of widespread humanitarian emergency, as industries closed, hospitals ran out of medicine, and the suicide rate sky-rocketed.

The credit default swap (CDS) is the best example of this transformation of life, resources and language into nihil. The CDS is a contract in which the buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments to the seller and, in exchange, receives a pay-off if an instrument – typically a bond or loan – goes into default (fails to pay). Less commonly, the credit event that triggers the pay-off can be the restructuring or bankruptcy of a company, or even simply the downgrading of its credit rating. If the financial game is based on the premise that the value of money invested will increase as things are annihilated (if factories are dismantled, jobs are destroyed, people die, cities crumble, and so on), this type of financial profiteering is essentially constructed upon a bet on the degradation of the world. From a Humanist perspective, finance reveals itself as an ideal form of crime, actively establishing suicide at the core of the social game.

This is why I believe that the contemporary global system should be defined as one of absolute capitalism, in which the only effective principles are those of value-accumulation, profit-growth and economic competition. These are its all-encompassing priorities, and the overwhelming impetus at its core. All other concerns, including the survival of the planet or the future of the next generation, are subsumed to these greater goals. Compared to the past situation of bourgeois industrial capitalism, the relationship between social welfare and financial profit is now inverted. In the industrial economy, profits increased when citizens acquired enough money to buy the goods that were produced in the factories. In the sphere of financial capitalism, financial indicators go up only if social welfare crumbles and salaries fall.

Live on Italian state radio, Borghezio claimed that he shared Breivik’s ‘opposition to Islam’, including his call for a ‘crusade’ by Christians against Europe’s ‘drift toward Islam’. He then added that positions like Breivik’s ‘account for 20 per cent of votes in Europe’, and that ‘100 million people think this way’. In a separate interview with Il Sole-24 radio station, Mr Borghezio declared that the ideas expressed by Breivik are generally ‘good – barring the violence – and some of them are great’.

Fascism was a fuzzy totalitarianism, a collage of different philosophical and political ideas, a beehive of contradictions. Can one conceive of a truly totalitarian movement that was able to combine monarchy with revolution, the Royal Army with Mussolini’s personal milizia, the grant of privileges to the Church with state education extolling violence, absolute state control with a free market?

But when the King fired Mussolini in 1943, the party reappeared two months later, with German support, under the standard of a ‘social’ republic, recycling its old revolutionary script, now enriched with almost Jacobin overtones.6

Indeed, in order to deny all possibility of becoming a Fascist, one ought first to resist any pressure to identify oneself. Unfortunately, it is not always particularly easy to avoid identification, particularly when social survival is threatened, as all other people become essentially competitors in the labour market or competitors in the occupation of territory. It is not easy to escape identification when the social community is attacked and people are unable to organize themselves around their interests and political rights, particularly when social solidarity is weak or entirely abrogated. In these instances, people understandably experience the need to find a point of identification in the phantoms of identitarian belonging – and identitarian belonging cannot find any foundation but aggressiveness toward other groups.

First of all, the European Union has been a political project of peace at the continental level. The war between France and Germany marked the history of European modernity from the beginning of the nineteenth century until the Second World War. It was not only a war between two nation states, but also a cultural war: Enlightenment versus Romanticism, universal reason versus cultural identity. Overcoming this opposition, which is at the very core of modernity, was the political assignment and the historical mission of the EU. This is the greatness of the European concept, which still appears to be the only political project to be able to interpret the present possibilities of the post-territorial machinery of the internet. But this project was cast aside and betrayed when the ruling class of the European nations opted for the fast track of financial and monetary unification, and transformed the political and cultural project that Benda describes into something quite different: a post-democratic system based on financial governance. The Maastricht Treaty was the sanction of a monetarist reduction of the European project. Oblivious to Julien Benda’s warnings, the European ruling class who gathered in Maastricht decided to found the European process on identity, rather than on political will and imagination. Whereas the European identity of the previous decades was based on economic prosperity and financial stability, the ruling class established the unification process on the Neoliberal dogma of infinite growth, financial balance, consumerism and the absolute power of the European Central Bank. But prosperity was not destined to last forever, and eventually financial absolutism displayed its violent side. At the outset, the European project was essentially a project of ‘will, spirit and imagination’, only to be subverted during the eighties and nineties into an affirmation of the economic identity of financial capitalism.

Deterritorialization is the passage from a space whose code is known to a new space, where that code loses its meaning, so that things become unrecognizable for anyone attempting to use the code that was produced by the previous territory. The history of capitalism is continuously producing effects of deterritorialization. At the outset, capitalism destroyed the old relation between the individual and both the agricultural territory and the family. Subsequently, it jeopardized the national borders and created a global space of exchange and communication. Currently, it is jeopardizing the very relation between money and production, and opening the way to a new form of immaterial semiotization. As capitalism destroys all forms of identification, it frees the individuals from the limitations of identity, but simultaneously it provokes a sense of displacement, a sort of opacity that is attributable to the loss of previous meanings and emotional roots. As a result, capitalism ultimately provokes a need for reterritorialization, and a continual return of the past in the shape of national identities, ethnic identities, sexual identities, and so on.

Semiocapitalism is based on the exploitation of neural energy. Attention is under siege, both in the space of production and in that of consumption. Attention implies a constant investment of nervous energy, and this is much more difficult to manage and is much more unpredictable than the muscular effort required of workers on the assembly line.

Matt Kennard writes: The PTSD epidemic is just one of many problems faced by the US military as it deals with the fallout from over a decade of war and occupation. Another dimension of its difficulties is that during the ‘war on terror’, the US military relaxed its entry criteria in order to cope with a mid-decade recruitment crisis. As a direct consequence, over 100,000 Americans with criminal convictions – including serious felony offenses from rape and murder, to assault – benefitted from the ‘moral waiver’ program, which allowed the military to look the other way when recruiting soldiers with shady pasts.6 Also: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is estimated to afflict upwards of 30 per cent of veterans, and while resources have been added, treatment for psychological ailments is sorely lacking. The greatest threat by far posed by traumatized veterans is not to others, but to themselves: it is estimated that 22 veterans in the US are committing suicide every day.

Suicide is a form of behaviour that has often been associated with those periods of anthropological catastrophe which are believed by the affected populations to herald the end of the world. After the Spanish colonization, thousands of Amerindians chose suicide – individually and also in organized forms – because they felt unable to come to terms with the new environment, the condition of slavery, religious obligations and so on. In the nineteenth century, suicide was adopted as a widespread behaviour in the industrial cities of the West, because of the intolerable conditions of urban life in the slums and of industrial work in factories. Suicide is a reaction of humans facing the destruction of their cultural references, and the humiliation of their dignity. This is one of the reasons that it so indelibly marks the landscape of our time.

Language is captured by the networked machine and turned into an essentially productive activity. Herein lies the trap: people are encouraged to consider their linguistic competence as factors of economic competition, and to manage and invest in them as such. Creativity, expressiveness, affection, emotion – the human soul, in other words – are considered to be productive factors, and consequently, they are evaluated according to standards of productivity. Exploitation, competition, precariousness, redundancy are not perceived as the effects of a conflictual social relationship, but are internalized as deficiencies of the self, as personal inadequacies. The unceasing restructuring of the organization of work is perceived as humiliation and brutality. Only non-involvement and the ability to remain extraneous, to refuse any identification with one’s job and with one’s working condition, only a radical rejection of the ethics of responsibility, might offer workers the possibility of navigating a way out from this productivity blackmail.

Unfortunately, the ethics of responsibility, the phoney discourse on participation and collaboration, are prevailing in today’s political and cultural life. We invest our psychic energies and our expectations into work because our intellectual and affective life is poor, because we are depressed, anxious and insecure. So we are trapped. The industrial worker who was obliged to repeat the same gesture a thousand times every day had no reason to identify with her work – so she invested her psychological energies into solidarity with colleagues, and her mind was free to hate the assembly line, and to entertain thoughts that had nothing to do with her daily slavery. Conversely, cognitive workers have been lured into the trap of creativity: their expectations are submitted to the productivity blackmail because they are obliged to identify their soul (the linguistic and emotional core of their activity) with their work. Social conflicts and dissatisfaction are perceived as psychological failures whose effect is the destruction of self-esteem.

On 26 September 2009 the front page of the French daily Le Monde opened with an article concerning productivity, ruthless competition and suicide of the employees at France Telecom. France Telecom, one of the most important tele-corporations in the world, was privatized in 1998. During the telecoms boom of the late nineties, France Telecom bought Orange, and the debt of the company escalated to 70 billion euros. In the following years a major restructuring drive reduced this figure, at the workers’ expense. From 2004 a recovery plan named ‘NeXT scheme’ was implemented: it was essentially aimed at reducing costs, especially wage costs, continuing a convergence policy for its products and services, and grouping together all the brands under the single brand of Orange. This recovery plan introduced an aggressive management style, whose top priority was to reduce the workforce. Forty thousand workers were fired in the eight years between 2002 and 2010. Since two-thirds of the France Telecom workers had public servant status, they could not be sacked, so the new directors ordered continuous changes of jobs and locations in order to dispirit well-qualified employees, most of whom were in their forties and fifties, and to force them to leave. Meanwhile, countless others remained stuck in high-pressure call centres, where individuals were expected to compete against each other for monthly results-based bonuses. ‘In a nutshell, it’s gone from a public service culture to a cash machine’, said Ivan du Roy, author of Stressed Orange, a book that maps out the company’s transformation.

Leaving aside the question of whether GM organisms are an actual threat to human health and biodiversity, the economic aspect of the problem appears to be very clear. Since the nineties, the policies of structural adjustment supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have forced India to adopt new agricultural policies, and to open up the market to corporations such as Montanto and Cargill. In Vandana Shiva’s words, The global corporations changed the input economy overnight. Farm saved seeds were replaced by corporate seeds, which need fertilizers and pesticides and cannot be saved. Corporations prevent seed savings through patents and by engineering seeds with non-renewable traits. As a result, poor peasants have to buy new seeds for every planting season and what was traditionally a free resource, available by putting aside a small portion of the crop, becomes a commodity. This new expense increases poverty and leads to indebtness … The crisis of suicides shows how the survival of small farmers is incompatible with the seed monopolies of global corporations. The region in India with the highest level of farmers suicides is the Vidharbha region in Maharashtra – 4000 suicides per year, 10 per day. This is also the region with the highest acreage of Monsanto’s GMO Bt cotton. Monsanto’s GM seeds create a suicide economy by transforming seed from a renewable resource to a non-renewable input which must be bought every year at high prices.10

The post-bourgeois capitalist class does not feel responsible for the community and the territory because financial capitalism is totally deterritorialized and has no interest in the future well-being of the community. On the other hand, the post-Fordist worker no longer shares the same interest as his/her colleagues, but, on the contrary, is forced to compete every day against other workers for a job and a salary in the deregulated labour arena. Within the framework of this new precarious organization of labour, building solidarity becomes a difficult task.

Marxists like Timpanaro are also exponents of so-called historical materialism, which we shall have more to say about later.6 Some of them (though a dwindling band these days) are also advocates of dialectical materialism, sometimes known more simply as Marxist philosophy.7 Historical materialism, as the term suggests, is a theory of history, whereas dialectical materialism, the founding work of which is Engels’ Dialectics of Nature, is a vastly more ambitious vision of reality. Its theoretical horizon is nothing less than the cosmos itself, which is doubtless one reason why it is out of favour in these pragmatic times. From ants to asteroids, the world is a dynamic complex of interlocking forces in which all phenomena are interrelated, nothing stays still, quantity converts into quality, no absolute standpoints are available, everything is perpetually on the point of turning into its opposite and reality evolves through the unity of conflicting powers. Those who deny this doctrine stand accused of being metaphysicians, falsely assuming that phenomena are stable, autonomous and discrete, that there are no contradictions in reality and that everything is itself and not some other thing.

Nor is it a Theory of Everything, as dialectical materialism aspires to be. It has nothing of pressing importance to say about the optic nerve or how to rustle up the fluffiest soufflé. It is a far more modest proposal – one which views class struggle, along with a conflict between the forces and relations of production, as the dynamic of epochal historical change.

What makes the difference for Aquinas is that human beings are linguistic as well as sensory animals. It is this which is the primary mark of our rationality. Our sensations are mediated by language, as a snail’s are not; and it is this above all that allows us a degree of self-distance, and thus of critical self-reflection. The sign-systems of dolphins are impressively intricate, but it is hard not to feel that they are overshadowed by the works of Proust.

For some idealist thinkers, though by no means for all, philosophy deals in history and culture, while the natural sciences deal in Nature. Historical materialism, by contrast, seeks to think both dimensions simultaneously, without conflating the two. The relations between them are not symmetrical. Though natural needs are socially mediated, for example, not all social needs are naturally based. There is no natural foundation to one’s desire to address the United Nations General Assembly dressed in a Winnie the Pooh outfit, however much it may feel that way. There are no false natural needs, but there are plenty of false social ones – the demand for lap dancers, for example, as opposed perhaps to laptops.

True human activity, by contrast, is a question of praxis – of the free realisation of one’s sensory and spiritual powers as enjoyable ends in themselves. Its model for Marx is the work of art. It is a question of happiness or well-being, which for Marx as for Aristotle is an activity rather than a state of mind. The most authentic form of production or ‘life activity’ (notions which for Marx extend far beyond the factory floor) is one executed for its own sake, free from the goad of physical necessity; and this in his view is one vital distinction between human beings and their more utilitarian-minded fellow animals. Under capitalist conditions, however, ‘life activity, productive life appears to man only as a means for the satisfaction of a need, the need to preserve physical existence’.21 We work in order to live, not as a form of service, solidarity and self-fulfilment. At the same time, other men and women (what Marx describes as ‘one’s greatest wealth’) become no more than a means for achieving one’s ends, and are consequently dematerialised.

For Marx, it is the result of the social relations in which our productive powers are caught up. And this is the point at which his somatic or anthropological materialism passes over into historical materialism. We now shift from describing how it is with the human animal to recounting a narrative about it. As long as our productive powers are fairly meagre, so the story goes, everyone has to labour simply to stay alive. Once society begins to generate an economic surplus, however, some individuals can be set free from the need to toil, and the result of this is the growth of social classes. A minority is able to seize control of production, dispose of the labour-power of others and appropriate for itself an inordinate slice of the surplus, while the majority battles to retain what it can of the fruits of its labour. Class struggle has set in.

At the same time, a number of figures emerge – priests, bards, shamans, counsellors, medicine men and the like – who hold sway over what one might call spiritual production. Their modern heirs are known as the intelligentsia. One function of this intellectual coterie is to come up with ideas that lend credence to the status quo, a process to which Marx gives the name of ideology. There is also the need for a coercive power that will regulate class struggle in the interests of the exploiters. This is known as the state.

For another thing, there is an ambiguity here about the term ‘consciousness’. It can mean the ideas implicit in our everyday activity, or it can refer to formal systems of concepts such as law, art, politics, ideology and the like. All of this is what Marx calls the superstructure; and in his view, consciousness in this sense is indeed finally determined by the ‘base’, by which he means the social relations of production. The relations between base and superstructure, however, are not equivalent to those between action and thought. The former is a sociological affair, while the latter is an epistemological question.

Marx’s attitude to philosophy is strikingly similar to Wittgenstein’s. Both men believe that it is essential only when things have gone awry. Our relation to the world, Marx insists, is not in general a theoretical one; but there are times when we need to indulge in this abnormal form of discourse, if only to arrive at the point where we can throw it away. There is, however, an important difference between the two thinkers here. Marx is intent on clearing the philosophical ground in order to launch a theory (historical materialism) of his own, whereas Wittgenstein looks askance on all such theorising, a term he tends to use pejoratively.

For Marx, however, it is not just a question of the impracticality of professors. The illusion that thought stands free of material reality springs from the division between mental and manual labour, which can only arise at a certain stage of social evolution. Once the production of an economic surplus allows an intelligentsia to appear, he writes, from this moment onwards consciousness can really flatter itself that it is something other than consciousness of existing practice, that it really represents something without representing something real; from now on consciousness is in a position to emancipate itself from the world and to proceed to the formation of ‘pure’ theory, theology, philosophy, ethics, etc.

The gap between ideas and reality is itself a product of reality. Ideas and practical existence are related in such a way as to be divided. And this division has material consequences. Ideas cease to be what Marx calls ‘a material force’ for social change. Instead, they play a partisan role in society in their very aloofness from such ends. What looks like a non-relation between thought and reality is thus one way in which the two are most closely coupled.

The idea of equality is an affront to his sense of the unique specificity of things, the utter incommensurability of one phenomenon with another. For him, even to say ‘leaf’ or ‘waterfall’ is to falsify.

Nietzsche opposes life to morality. In doing so, however, he fails to appreciate that the most resourceful moral thought, from Aristotle and Aquinas to Hegel and Marx, views morality precisely in terms of human flourishing. It recognises all the same that one needs to specify what counts as such flourishing in a given situation, which is what moral discourse serves to do; and on this question Nietzsche himself is mostly silent. He is unable to come up with the criteria by which one might judge an action to be an authentic flourish of life. (One such criterion – the general augmenting of human happiness – is a particular object of his derision. Only the Englishman, he jeers, believes that.) Marx, by contrast, has such a criterion, which he inherits from Hegel: morally commendable action involves realising one’s powers reciprocally, in and through the similar self-realisation of others. It is not a knock-down argument. But it is an advance on claiming that enslaving entire peoples is justified by the fact that it yields you a gratifying sense of euphoria.

They are part of what it means to be a human body, however much any specific body may be culturally conditioned. It is on this material foundation that the most durable forms of human solidarity can be built.

The incongruence of Gandhi has a different slant. Anyone who sees in him a paragon should pick up Kathryn Tidrick’s masterful biography of the mahatma. During his time living in South Africa, he found his British masters marching off to the Boer War – and ran after, begging them to enlist him and his fellow Indians. A few years later, the British again paraded out to the provinces, now to the Zulus who rebelled against oppressive taxes and had to be flogged and mass executed into submission, and again Gandhi asked to serve. To his disappointment, he was taken on only as a stretcher-bearer and nurse on both occasions, but in his autobiography he claimed his share of martial glory by arguing that medical staff are as indispensable to war as any soldiers on the front. ‘Gandhi famously resisted any use of violence’, runs the standard characterisation, here in the words of yet another writer who thinks the climate movement should model itself on the mahatma. Did he? Perhaps the Boer and Zulu episodes were youthful blunders?

Hardly had the First World War broken out before Gandhi offered up to the Empire himself and as many Indians as he could dispose of. In early 1918, certain movements were busy trying to end the slaughter, agitating for soldiers to desert and turn against their generals, at which point Gandhi decided that more Indians had to be thrown into the trenches. ‘If I became your recruiting agent-in-chief, I might rain men on you’, he flattered the viceroy, promising another half million Indian men on top of the one million already in regiments or graveyards, leaving no stone in the countryside unturned in his search for eager volunteers (few showed up, which he considered a profoundly humiliating setback). In these recruitment drives, the mahatma pursued a logic of sorts. As long as Indians were effeminate and weak, the British would never consider them equals and grant them independence; to recuperate their manhood and strength, they had to become brothers-in-arms. Gandhi’s strategy for national liberation never – this is true – condoned violence against the British, but it did include violence with them.

In the case of war, Hitler might implement ‘a general massacre of the Jews’, but ‘if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving’, for ‘to the god-fearing, death has no terror. It is a joyful sleep’. Facing objections, Gandhi had to clarify his comments and add subsidiary arguments – Jews have never mastered the art of non-violence; if only they could take on their suffering with courage, even ‘the stoniest German heart will melt’ – indeed, ‘I plead for more suffering and still more till the melting has become visible to the naked eye’ (January 1939).

Selective memory applies to South Africa too. It took more than divestment to bring down apartheid. It also took more than civil disobedience: in the 1950s and early ’60s, the African National Congress (ANC) experimented with bus boycotts, strikes, pass-burning, campaigns to refuse segregation in trains and post offices and found that they invited little else than overwhelming repression. After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, the ANC leaders realised that they had to ratchet up the pressure and formed Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Spear of the Nation, or MK.

I once asked Bill McKibben, after an energising speech to a capacity crowd, when – given that the situation is as urgent as he portrayed it and we all know it is – we escalate. He was visibly ill at ease. The first part of his response presented what we might call the objection from asymmetry: as soon as a social movement engages in violent acts, it moves onto the terrain favoured by the enemy, who is overwhelmingly superior in military capabilities. The state loves a fight of arms; it knows it will win. Our strength is in numbers. This is a pet argument for strategic pacifists, but it is disingenuous. Violence is not the sole field where asymmetry prevails. The enemy has overwhelmingly superior capabilities in virtually all fields, including media propaganda, institutional coordination, logistical resources, political legitimacy and, above all, money. If the movement should shun uphill battles, a divestment campaign seems like the worst possible choice: trying to sap fossil capital by means of capital.

With the emergence of a flank, positions shift. That is when progress can be made: when representatives of XR sit down with the British government to negotiate a path to zero emissions by 2025 – perhaps the ministers will insist on 2028 – some mitigation would finally be underway. To end up on that table, XR or its equivalents might need a little unrequested assistance, just as MLK once did. It is the duty of the erstwhile radicals to denounce the new flank and accuse it of undermining their endeavours. If they were to applaud the troublemakers who threaten or commit acts of violence, they would not gain the edge of respectability and receive no invitation to the policy-making chambers. A positive radical flank effect presupposes, with Haines, ‘a division of labor in which moderates and radicals perform very different roles’: the latter stoke up the crisis to a breaking-point, the former offer a way out. It follows that prospective militants should expect and even hope for condemnation from the mainstream, without which the two would become indistinguishable and the effect be lost. Put differently, they should not try to convince XR or Bill McKibben or any other part of the movement committed to absolute non-violence to pick up the cocktails and the canisters – it’s not their job. It’s the job of the factions to come.

The incident of the stormed compound took on a life of its own, as a sign of the purportedly violent nature of Ende Gelände in eastern Germany. It brought home more absurdities of the situation: the breaking of fences could be officially framed as massiven kriminellen Gewalttaten, devastation, unimaginable damage, whereas the perpetual cloud of CO2 from Schwarze Pumpe was the mark of a peaceful normality. This warping had something to do with the political conjuncture in those eastern districts, where the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – the far-right party that denies climate, loves coal and wants the bottom of the German mines to be scraped – has its main bastions of support. No one was more incensed about the incursion than the AfD. In the hours after it, a mob of far-right activists and locals assaulted several of the Ende Gelände blockades, shooting fire-crackers into them and chasing activists in cars. More violence of that kind should perhaps be anticipated, as the task of defending fossil capital is passed on to the far right in Europe and elsewhere.

Anarchism: The name given to a principle or theory of life and conduct under which society is conceived without government—harmony in such a society being obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being. -Peter Kropotkin (Encyclopedia Brittanica)

Zapatistas do not call themselves anarchists, quite, or even, quite autonomists; they represent their own unique strand within that broader tradition; indeed, they are trying to revolutionize revolutionary strategy itself by abandoning any notion of a vanguard party seizing control of the state, but instead battling to create free enclaves that could serve as models for autonomous selfgovernment, allowing a general reorganization of Mexican society into a complex overlapping network of self managing groups that could then begin to discuss the reinvention of political society. There was, apparently, some difference of opinion within the Zapatista movement itself over the forms of democratic practice they wished to promulgate. The Mayaspeaking base pushed strongly for a form of consensus process adopted from their own communal traditions, but reformulated to be more radically egalitarian; some of the Spanish-speaking military leadership of the rebellion were highly skeptical of whether this could really be applied on the national level. Ultimately, though, they had to defer to the vision of those they “led by obeying,” as the Zapatista saying went. But the remarkable thing was what happened when news of this rebellion spread to the rest of the world. It’s here we can really see the workings of Leve’s “identity machine.” Rather than a band of rebels with a vision of radical democratic transformation, they were immediately redefined as a band of Mayan Indians demanding indigenous autonomy. This is how the international media portrayed them; this is what was considered important about them from everyone from humanitarian organizations to Mexican bureaucrats to human rights monitors at the UN.

In Putin’s new rendition of anti-Americanism, it is not consumerism that weakens the unity of the nation – quite the reverse: it supports and consolidates the national economy. Nowadays it is unlikely that someone would detect an American plot in the Russian elite’s excessive desire for luxury or the population’s menacingly high dependence on credit. Today, the danger comes from elsewhere – from homosexuality and feminism, which are allegedly destroying the traditional family.

In effect, Lukács explains in the terms of Kant’s moral philosophy the contradiction of a workers’ state, which was formulated in the terms of Marxist theory by Lenin in State and Revolution. This text was written in August 1917, on the eve of the Bolsheviks’ seizure of power. Lenin assumed that the state the revolutionaries were about to seize would cease to be a continuation of the old type, an instrument of one class’s domination of the others. On the contrary, Lenin’s ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is a dictatorship to end all dictatorships. For Lenin, the mission of the new proletarian state lay in proving itself unnecessary to a victorious class, the true class interest of which lay in dissolving both its own domination and itself in a consciously organized society. The task of the Bolsheviks should be not to reinforce the state apparatus they inherit from previous overlords, but to ‘smash and break it’. According to Lenin’s thinking, such a state should not attempt to present itself as a moral force, an educator of the masses; on the contrary, it must convince these masses that they no longer need any educators.

‘Reflection on the USSR has been marred – and still is – by two frequent errors,’ Moshe Lewin wrote in his classic work The Soviet Century. ‘The first is to take anti-communism for a study of the Soviet Union. The second – a consequence of the first – consists in ‘Stalinizing’ the whole Soviet phenomenon, as if it had been one giant gulag from beginning to end.’1 This ‘Stalinization’ has automatically tended to cover the entire period of the Soviet Union’s existence, so shutting down the possibility of a truly in-depth investigation of Soviet society, its internal contradictions and its social character.

Objecting to Solzhenitsyn in a samizdat publication, Roy Medvedev claimed that for his opponent ‘there is no difference at all between the ideals of socialism and their actual implementation’. He continued, ‘Solzhenitsyn refuses to admit that the reason why communism triumphed in the twentieth century first in such countries as Russia and China was because the suffering of … millions of people was particularly harsh’.94 Medvedev examined Solzhenitsyn’s article in detail, revealing his manipulation of the facts, his distortion of quotations and the absence of inner logic in his writing. Yet for a significant section of the samizdat readers, his conclusions were barely convincing. On the contrary, Medvedev’s position was seen as that of an overly conciliatory conformist, in contrast to the uncompromising stance of the author of the Gulag Archipelago.

Adherents of popular Stalinism were, on the whole, sceptical of any form of self-organization or resistance from below to the existing order, pinning their hopes on healthy elements within the power structures, police and security services. Yuri Andropov, former head of the KGB, who was in power in the Party and the country between 1982 and 1984, tried to build on these widespread sentiments when he carried out large-scale arrests of high-ranking Soviet trade employees accused of corruption and theft of public funds. In addition, Stalinism in various forms continued to exist at different levels of the Party, state and academic bureaucracy, along with a view that Soviet society was insufficiently secure from the penetration of Western, pro-capitalist influence.

The rapid rise in the new president’s popularity was largely due to a hegemonic model that had been absent in the previous period. The Putin majority was an alliance, on the one hand, of big business, which wanted firm guarantees for property acquired in the 1990s and continued market reforms, and which sought the return of a strong centralized government by the bureaucracy and the army, and, on the other, of millions of employees who were tired of constant salary delays and social instability.

He used the metaphor of a pasture overgrazed by selfish peasants to warn how certain races, religions, or classes would exploit the largesse of the welfare state to subsidize the ‘freedom to breed’.67 In 1974, he outlined his ‘lifeboat ethics’ as a Malthusian analogue to Fuller’s ‘spaceship Earth’. ‘Metaphorically, each rich nation amounts to a lifeboat full of comparatively rich people’, Hardin explained, while the poor nations are lifeboats so crowded that ‘the poor fall out’ and hope to benefit from the ‘goodies’ in the rich lifeboats.68 The Malthusian imperative was simple: let them drown.

There are different variants of Malthusianism, but often little separates the genocidal from the respectable strains. This split can be found in the example of Malthus himself, who condoned starvation for poor Britons, but was appalled by the genocide of Indigenous nations in North America – a tragedy that he blamed on American population growth.69 It is ironic then that Hardin warned of a ‘passive genocide’ of whites caused by people of colour ‘outbreed[ing]’ them, and called for the US state to coercively control the reproduction of non-white women.70 Despite his abhorrent rhetoric, Hardin remains one of the most cited scholars of all time and his framework is often taught sans critique to undergraduates.71

the neoliberal conception of the market is derived from Marxism. However, before we delve into this snarled intellectual history, we must first understand what capital is. For Marx, capital is less a thing than a set of social relations. It emerges from the relationship between capitalists and workers, after the latter have been separated from the ‘means of production’ (e.g., farmland, tools) and forced to sell their labour on the market, and it is sustained by capitalists competing against each other in the pursuit of maximal profit. Thus, unemployment and the need to make the going rate of profit constrain the freedom of both classes, albeit in unequal fashion. Capitalism is an unusual social form in that the elite do not directly control the labour of the lower classes, as was the case with pre-capitalist societies (e.g., via the corvée or tithe), nor are investment decisions guided by a product’s direct utility (‘use-value’) but by the opportunity to garner profit from selling it to others (‘exchange-value’). Despite being a product of human social relations, capital confronts said humans as an autonomous force guiding their actions: the market takes on a life of its own.

Counter-intuitively, the capitalist is not the ‘master’ in a capitalist society, as both Hegel and Marx realized.91 The master is capital itself. Marx calls it the ‘automatic subject’, an unconscious force: ‘constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities, it changes its own magnitude, throws off surplus-value from itself considered as original value, and thus valorizes itself independently.’92

Compared with ancient tyrants or mediaeval kings, whose wills were constrained only by the wills of other masters and nature itself, capitalists make a strange elite. Pressures from the market dehumanize the capitalist, reducing her to the hybrid creature Marx called ‘capital personified and endowed with consciousness and a will’.96 To illustrate the dual imprisonment of both worker and capitalist, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer turned to The Odyssey for inspiration. They compare the rowers of Odysseus’ ship, who avoid the Sirens’ treacherous songs by plugging their ears with wax, to factory workers whose craft has been stripped of all beauty and pleasure. Rather than enjoying their labour, the rowers must ‘look ahead with alert concentration and ignore anything which lies to one side’.97 Odysseus, the fable’s capitalist, is also unfree. He is strapped to the mast so that he does not surrender to the Sirens, those representatives of life’s sensuous and aesthetic pleasures. There might be less sweat on his brow, but otherwise Odysseus’ fate is no freer than his men’s. For Adorno and Horkheimer, the parable represents the moment when ‘the enjoyment of art and manual work diverge as the primeval world is left behind’ because of capital’s ‘inescapable compulsion toward the social control of nature’.98

You might dream of leaving the law to become a teacher in a Steiner school, but you will probably conclude that it is a whimsical, unrealistic idea – and so will most of your friends.

This desire, he says, encapsulates a range of liberating ideas: I don’t want to join the rat race. Not be enslaved by machines, bureaucracies, boredom, ugliness. I don’t want to be a moron, robot, commuter. I don’t want to become a fragment of a person. I want to do my own thing. I want to live (relatively) simply. I want to deal with people, not masks.

The best option available for my parents was the default path. This worked remarkably well for them, which is what made leaving it so damn hard. I know how much they sacrificed so that I would have better career opportunities. However, what they really gave me was so much more than the ability to succeed in school and work. It was space to dream, take risks, and be able to explore more possibilities for my life.

In 1946, the United States formalized this by passing the Full Employment Act “to promote maximum employment.”39 This created a clear metric that everyone could use to judge a government’s performance and today, political leaders do whatever possible to protect or create jobs. One striking example is from 2009 when U.S. President Barack Obama explicitly mentioned jobs as the reason why he did not want to pursue a more ambitious healthcare policy: Everybody who supports single‑payer healthcare says, ‘Look at all this money we would be saving from insurance and paperwork.’ That represents 1 million, 2 million, 3 million jobs of people who are working at Blue Cross Blue Shield or Kaiser or other places. What are we doing with them? Where are we employing them?40

In 2008, attorney Kenneth Feinberg was appointed to a position in which he set the salaries of bank executives involved in the global financial crisis. He had to inform executives who made $5 million the previous year that they would only be making $1 million in the upcoming year. He expected them to be frustrated but understand, given the broader challenges in the economy. That’s not what happened. Most were outraged. He realized that “these corporate officials viewed their compensation as the sole barometer of self-worth.” He wasn’t lowering their salaries; he was dealing a blow to the essence of who they thought they were.50

Yet when I became self‑employed, I was surprised at how strongly I had internalized a worker identity. As I struggled to find my first project, I felt guilty when I wasn’t working during typical work hours Monday through Friday. When I started working remotely on my first project, I had 100% control over when and how I did the work, but quickly fell into a routine of going to a coworking office five days a week. Many self‑employed people are surprised to find that once they no longer have to work for anyone else, they still have a manager in their head.

One challenge to embracing possibility is knowing when to override what psychology professors Gilovich and Davidai call our “‘ought to’ self.” This is the voice that helps us follow through on commitments but can also keep us from making changes in our lives. This is the voice that might convince you that leaving a job is an abdication of responsibility. We “ought to” keep working. This impulse is helpful most of the time, but compounded over one’s life it stops us from moving towards what Gilovich and Davidai call our “ideal self.” When people reflect on their lives, these are the things that people regret most – not moving towards their ideal selves. The professors argue that people rarely regret the things they do in their lives. This is exactly because of the power of our “ought to” selves – even if we fail, we tend to take immediate action to fix those mistakes.

Their case for embracing nuclear power, which hitherto has been the bugbear of rank-and-file greens, depends on three assumptions: nuclear power is safe; nuclear plants provide ‘carbon-free’ power; and there are promising new nuclear technologies such as ‘fast-breeder’ reactors. None of these claims holds up under scrutiny.

Rather than countenance changing how the Northern bourgeoisie (the social base of the environmental movement) lives, leading environmentalists put their trust in a technology as dangerous as nuclear power. It has been estimated that there is currently a 50 per cent chance of a disaster on the scale of Fukushima or worse every sixty-two years, and of Three Mile Island every fifteen.41 If Hansen got his way and thousands of new reactors were built, then there would almost certainly be two, three, many Fukushimas (to paraphrase Che Guevara). A critical part of the pro-nuclear greens’ argument is that there have been relatively few fatalities from nuclear accidents, even large ones like Fukushima and Chernobyl. According to Hansen and his peers, these nuclear meltdowns killed perhaps a few dozen people in Ukraine in 1986, while nobody died in Japan in 2011.42 This is nonsense. In 2006, the World Health Organization finally abandoned this ridiculous charade and raised Chernobyl’s estimated death toll from 54 to 9,000.43 Since then, the estimates have risen precipitously. That same year, a study carried out for the European Parliament offered the range of 30,000 to 60,000 deaths, while in 2019, historian Kate Brown argued there were between 35,000 and 150,000 deaths at a minimum.44

Explorers, the historian Aaron Sachs wrote me in answer to a question, “were always lost, because they’d never been to these places before. They never expected to know exactly where they were. Yet, at the same time, many of them knew their instruments pretty well and understood their trajectories within a reasonable degree of accuracy. In my opinion, their most important skill was simply a sense of optimism about surviving and finding their way.” Lost, these people I talked to helped me understand, was mostly a state of mind, and this applies as much to all the metaphysical and metaphorical states of being lost as to blundering around in the backcountry.

Water was cheap and powerful, besting coal on both counts for almost three generations after Arkwright’s mill was built. The shift from water to coal occurred because capitalists sought to reassert control over unruly workers.

In 1961, he began painting relief maps this same trademark blue, so that the topography remained but the other distinctions vanished. Several of these maps depicted sections of France but one showed Europe and northern Africa together. Painted into one continuous mass, the distinctions vanished, even between Algeria and France, which were at war at the time. “Klein used color,” writes art historian Nan Rosenthal, “as though it could be an explicit and overtly political tool for ending wars.” He had always been against making distinctions and divisions, fulminating even against the line in painting and celebrating the unifying force of color instead. And his work is a reminder that, however beautiful, with their ships and dragons, those old maps were tools of empire and capital. Science is how capitalism knows the world, a friend remarks to me, and the distinctions and details these maps marked out were first of all for merchants and military expeditions. What was marked “Terra Incognita” was also what remained unvanquished. Painting the world blue made it all terra incognita, indivisible and unconquerable, a ferocious act of mysticism.

Unlike Kantorovich (but like Neurath), Beer had the opportunity to put his ideas into practice at scale. Beer’s apotheosis from mere theorist to socialist immortal occurred not because of his influence on Gosplan or CEMI but through his participation in the ill-fated utopian ‘Project Cybersyn’ (or ‘Synco’ in Spanish). Although Chile in the early 1970s might seem far removed from the global crises in the 2020s, Cybersyn is perhaps the closest historical analogue to Half-Earth socialism. Beer designed the system to manage Chile’s state-owned industries as part of President Salvador Allende’s peaceful transition to socialism. The task was challenging, in part because the number of state-controlled factories, mines, and infrastructures increased by the day, and each required cutting-edge management and technical expertise. The viable system model was a natural choice for this fiendishly complex problem; like Kantorovich’s meeting with the plywood engineers, this was a moment when theory and practice joined to further socialism. New technologies, such as telex machines, promised to overcome the problem of co-ordinating information in a far-flung country.85

János Kornai, a Hungarian economist, had a hard-nosed but fair theory of actually existing socialism. Indeed, his work achieved the rare feat of garnering respect on both sides of the Iron Curtain.107 In short, he argued that socialism inevitably led towards a shortage economy.108 The causes were myriad but ultimately boiled down to the way individuals behave in a planned economy. While capitalist firms are motivated by maximizing profit, socialist firms were primarily motivated by satisfying output quotas set by a bureaucracy. This led to pathological behaviours, such as duplicated capacity, where firms created their own additional productive units to secure small batches of supplies because they did not trust other factories to produce necessary intermediate goods. This made output more reliable but negated any gains from economies of scale. While an inefficient capitalist enterprise is punished by going under, the inefficient socialist firm had only the Party to fear – and the Party had interests other than efficiency (as Kantorovich knew only too well). The underperforming but favoured firm would always receive help, while a well-run factory could be shut down if it antagonized a powerful patron.109

If Ged’s desire for glory and domination leads to catastrophe, Half-Earth socialism errs on the side of humility and restraint. The state is still political – conscious control over the economy means the politicization of everything – but once equality is achieved through the universal recognition of each other’s worth and the natural world is stabilized, then statecraft will be reduced to mere administration. It will ‘wither away’ in the sense that politics will eventually be as mundane as devising bus routes. Instead of succumbing to fervid nationalist passions, the international socialist can relate to broader humanity as if they were fellow bus passengers. Care, curiosity, and self-awareness will surpass domination over fellow humans and the natural world during this epoch of rest.

since the 1980s, successive governments and big business have worked to promote a new vision of mental health; one that puts at its centre a new kind of person: resilient, optimistic, individualistic and above all, economically productive – the kind of person the new economy needs and wants. As a result of this shift, our entire approach to mental health has radically altered to meet these market demands. We define ‘return to health’ as a ‘return to work’. We blame suffering on faulty minds and brains rather than on harmful social, political and work environments. We promote highly profitable drug interventions, which, if great news for big pharmaceutical corporations, are in the long term holding millions of people back.

The cosmetics industry locates our misery in our ageing, the diet industry in our bodily imperfections, the fashion industry in our being passé, and the pharmaceutical industry in our so-called faulty brain chemicals. While each industry offers its own profitable elixir for emotional success, they all share and promote the same consumerist philosophy of suffering: your central problem is not that you’ve been mis-taught how to understand and engage with your difficulties (your ageing, your trauma, your sadness, your anxiety or grief), but the fact that you experience suffering at all – something that targeted consumption can address. Suffering is the new bad, and failing to consume the right ‘remedies’ is the new injustice.

The data I had gathered appeared to support the growing international criticism of the DSM then playing out internationally in leading newspapers and medical journals.6 A central criticism of this sprawling ‘book of woe’ is that since the 1980s it has unjustifiably expanded the definition of mental illness to encompass more and more domains of human experience. It achieved this by rapidly increasing the number of mental disorders believed to exist (from 106 in the early 1970s to around 370 today), and by progressively lowering the bar for what constitutes a psychiatric disorder (making it easier for any of us to be classed as ‘mentally ill’).7 These processes resulted in much of our everyday human distress being wrongly medicalised, pathologised and eventually medicated.

Psychiatric labels, in other words, do not correspond to known biological pathologies that treatments can then target and ‘cure’. They are rather socially constructed labels ascribed to collections of feelings and behaviours deemed disordered or pathological by the psychiatric committees who compiled the DSM.

The DSM’s categorisation of diverse human experiences into approximately 370 separate psychiatric disorders was not, then, the outcome of solid neurobiological research. It was mostly based on vote-based judgements reached by small, select groups of DSM psychiatrists – judgements then ratified and seemingly scientifically legitimised by their inclusion in the manual. The fact that the majority of these psychiatrists (including the DSM’s three previous chairs) also had financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry is of course hardly inconsequential, given that the industry has profited immensely from the vast expansion of DSM that such financially conflicted psychiatrists have engineered.12

why DSM sales were so high: ‘The bottom line is that the pharmaceutical industry has been buying DSM in bulk and then distributing copies for free to clinicians up and down the country,’ she said. ‘That’s why the figures are soaring.’ For her, it was obvious why the pharmaceutical industry would do this: ‘As almost any kind of suffering is caught by the DSM, disseminating it is just good business: it drives up diagnosis rates and with this, prescriptions.’ Indeed, as the most important chairperson in the history of the DSM, Robert Spitzer, later acknowledged: ‘the pharmaceuticals were delighted’ with the manual’s widespread medicalisation of distress, as it created a vast and highly profitable market for their products.13

According to the NHS’s own Independent Mental Health Taskforce, mental health outcomes have actually worsened in recent years, as have rates of suicide.23 In fact, since 2006, there has been an 11 per cent increase in suicides in people who use mental health services,24 and, despite widening access to services,25 no reduction at all in the prevalence of mental disorders since the 1980s.26 Additionally, while as a society we have made some extraordinary gains in life expectancy over the last fifty years (largely due to biomedical advances in general medicine), for people diagnosed with severe mental health problems, the gap between their life expectancy and everyone else’s has doubled since the 1980s.27 In fact, in the UK, the mortality of those suffering from severe and sustained emotional distress is now 3.6 times higher than in the general population, with people so diagnosed dying approximately twenty years earlier than the average person.28

While some people report feeling validated by receiving a psychiatric diagnosis, building their identity around it, research shows that having our emotional distress reframed as mental ‘disorder’, ‘illness’ or ‘dysfunction’ (which, incidentally, is now a precondition for accessing NHS services in the UK) may adversely impact our recovery. This is especially true if people are led to believe that their problems are rooted in biological abnormalities, which calling these problems ‘medical’ or ‘mental illness’ encourages.37 For example, people who come to believe their problems are due to chemical imbalances experience worse pessimism about their recovery, increased self-stigma, more negative expectations and self-blame38 as well as more depressive symptoms after the close of their treatment,39 compared to people who reject this hypothesis.

That is, reframe suffering as being rooted in individual rather than social causes, leading individuals to think that it is them rather than the economic and social system in which they live that is at fault and in need of reform. Redefine individual well-being in terms consistent with the goals of the economy. Well-being should be characterised as comprising those feelings, values and behaviours (e.g. personal ambition, competition and industrious endeavour) that serve economic growth and increased productivity, irrespective of whether they are actually good for the individual and the community. Turn behaviours and emotions that might negatively impact the economy into a call for more medical intervention. Behaviours and feelings that perturb or disrupt the established order (e.g. low worker satisfaction) should be medicalised and treated, as these can frustrate the economic interests of powerful financial institutions and elites. Turn suffering into a vibrant market opportunity for more consumption. Suffering should become highly lucrative to big business as it begins to manufacture and market its so-called solutions – solutions from which increased tax revenues, profits and higher share value can be extracted.

As the reality of borrowing large amounts of money looms, more students are forced to think pragmatically, fiscally, electing to study safe subjects they feel will lead to the highest-paid jobs. This explains why as student fees go up, applications for creative and humanities subjects go down.5 It also explains why modern students are more likely to become fiscally conservative early on, as they’ve been socialised by debt into deferring to a life of repayment. For Chomsky, debt renders students conformists in the economy, forcing them to accept rather than oppose the economic realities of the system they are entering. Debt, in other words, is a potent form of socialisation into neo-liberalism – forcing young people to submit, early on, to the economic status quo.

While these and other data continued to support Whitaker’s position, an authoritative piece of neurobiological research soon added a somewhat more unnerving dimension. One of America’s foremost neuroscientists, Professor Nancy Andreasen, led a team exploring how long-term drug use affected the brain. What the MRI scans revealed was that long-term use of certain antipsychotics was ‘associated with smaller brain tissue volumes’ (with decreases in both white and grey matter). Crucially, this degeneration was not a symptom of the ‘disease’, as previously thought, but rather an outcome of long-term psychiatric drug use. While these degenerating effects had long been shown in animal studies, this was the first time brain shrinkage was shown in humans as a result of medications.27

Cipriani’s study concluded that, for the minority of patients classed as severely depressed, they did in fact work a little better than placebos. This led many senior psychiatrists, in the study’s press release, to hype the results in the most positive way, which shaped the global media coverage. The press release comments that drove the headlines included: ‘This meta-analysis finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants’; ‘Antidepressants do work and, for most people, the side-effects are worth it’; and ‘For the millions of individuals with depression who are taking antidepressants at present … it confirms that these drugs are safe and effective.’ What most people reading these statements almost certainly did not know was that, firstly, they were all issued by psychiatrists with strong financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry, and, secondly, these comments entirely glossed over the serious limitations of Cipriani’s work. As myself and colleagues pointed out in our Lancet response to the study,34 the differences found by Cipriani between placebo and antidepressant were so minor that they actually did not pass the threshold for ‘clinical significance’ – meaning that the clinical benefits of taking an antidepressant rather than a placebo would hardly register in a person’s actual experience.35 Moreover, as Cipriani’s study only looked at trials on people who had been taking antidepressants for 8–12 weeks, his findings were irrelevant to most users today, as the vast majority of people on antidepressants take them for many months or years. Finally, when you assess people who have been taking antidepressants over the long term, not only are the effects even lower than those found by Cipriani,36 but the drugs actually worsen the course of depression for many, as Robert Whitaker’s work above clearly illustrates.

Today, around 4.4 million people in England have been taking antidepressants for longer than two years, even though we now know that a large proportion of these long-term users have overcome their difficulties and should be actively withdrawing.40 Not only is this unnecessary long-term prescribing at huge public expense, but it is also at huge human cost, as more people are rendered disabled needlessly by the damaging effects long-term use can cause, as we have seen.

If the above myths help propel unnecessary long-term antidepressant consumption, they nevertheless pale in comparison to the next driving factor. This is the dominant myth that any withdrawal effects that accompany stopping antidepressants are invariably mild and short-lived (usually lasting for only 1–2 weeks). The origins of this myth can be traced to a symposium held in 1996, which was funded by the drug company Eli Lilly, the maker of the antidepressant Prozac. Here a committee of company-funded psychiatrists reached the consensus that antidepressant withdrawal was largely a minor affair, resolving over about a week. From here, this myth eventually made its way into clinical guidelines internationally, despite it enjoying no real corroborating research. As it took root in clinical practice, doctors who then encountered severe or protracted withdrawal reactions would often deny these reactions, rather believing that their patients were relapsing into their original problems. As a consequence, drugs would often be reinstated and longer-term use would ensue. This dynamic may partly explain why, since the guidelines were issued in 2004, the length of time the average person in the UK spends on an antidepressant has doubled.

Despite the different measures and definitions used in the studies I consulted, they all consistently showed that the highest numbers of employees (around two-thirds) were located in the ‘not engaged’ or ‘dissatisfied’ categories.11 This meant that the majority of UK workers experienced no positive emotional engagement in the work they did (it left them emotionally cold, so to speak) and/or they simply disliked their jobs (they were dissatisfied, bored or unhappy at work). This was also consistent with more recent research from 2018 revealing that around 55 per cent of Brits feel under excessive pressure, exhausted or regularly miserable at work,12 and that nearly 40 per cent feel their jobs make no meaningful contribution to the world. More startling, 46 per cent of men say they believe their jobs to be entirely meaningless.13 In short, and to amend slightly one of the Tube posters, not only do huge swathes of us spend our days performing tasks we secretly believe do not really need to be performed, but a significant proportion of us also find our work meaningless, dissatisfying and/or emotionally disengaging.

So what are the classic signs of ‘mental illness’ that managers should try to identify in their colleagues? Well, fortunately, ACAS provides a list: Uncommunicative or moody behaviour Poor performance Poor timekeeping Poor decision-making Lack of energy An increase in unexplained absences or sick leave Given the countless understandable reasons why someone could manifest any of these issues at work, it is odd that ACAS provides no rationale for why these signs should be reframed as so-called symptoms of illness. This is all the more surprising since none of the signs actually map onto any official diagnostic criteria for depression or anxiety (as problematic as these criteria can be),24 and all of them could be interpreted in manifold non-medical ways – as classic signs of worker dissatisfaction and disengagement, for starters.

Given the evident benefits such consultancies bring to organisations, it is little wonder that they continue to thrive despite there being no evidence for their effectiveness – no research showing they make people less distressed and more productive at work. But perhaps, from the standpoint of company and organisational interests, being effective is not really the point. After all, when push comes to shove, these programmes still deliver significant value for money, by largely helping to control the narrative about what causes workplace distress. By removing difficult work experiences from the domain of public discussion, and placing them into the private domain of the consultancy room, the negative effects of modern work can be medicalised, individualised and depoliticised and thus more safely, quietly and confidentially diffused.

The failure of IAPT has therefore nothing to do with its being a state-run initiative, but rather with its being a particular type of state initiative. Built into IAPT’s philosophical DNA are political and economic aspirations that are irrelevant to the core needs of the people involved in the service: such as a patient’s need to overcome their distress in a meaningful way, or a professional’s sense of vocation for their work. Rather, IAPT aims to satisfy broader economic ambitions, such as those advanced by David Clark and Lord Layard when they marketed their vision to the British government in 2005, promising to save the economy billions of pounds each year.

If you did not attend your placement, you would have your benefits stopped – or, as it was put, ‘sanctioned’. As a result, thousands of people (and their families) were thrown into abject poverty, sometimes because the claimant had simply resisted a placement, often for health reasons, or because they had made minor mistakes such as filling in a form improperly or being late for an appointment. In fact, so strict were the sanctioning rules that by 2013, over a million unemployed people had been penalised – with the majority of the sanctions falling on either disabled people6 or on those living in districts where it was harder to get a job.7 These draconian policies, which did indeed help cut the benefits bill, had serious social consequences, significantly contributing to the rise in homelessness and food banks over the same period, and increasing severe anxiety and depression among the unemployed by 50 per cent8 and, with that, the number of attempted suicides by 25 per cent.9 Programmes like workfare were not only exploitative and stigmatising, they were also making people ill.

Local and national media interest soon grew, and as the public learnt more about the underground exploitation taking place, any association with the workfare programme became almost toxic. One by one companies started opting out of the scheme; an exodus that was hastened when the High Court ruled in 2015 that the government had acted unlawfully by not providing enough information about the sanctions faced by those refusing to take part in workfare.

The DWP seemed to have a clear purpose in mind: to recast unemployment as a psychological deficit that compulsory training would somehow correct. ‘And this is why we opted for the term psycho-compulsion,’ said Friedli, ‘because it reflected what we were finding across the country: the proliferation of compulsory and coercive practices designed to alter the internal attitudes, dispositions and psychology of unemployed people.’

Psycho-compulsion is therefore not just about instilling people with a so-called correct employability mindset. It is a mechanism for penalising deviation from what it defines as the right set of attitudes and behaviours. ‘What psycho-compulsion therefore attempts to do is silence alternative discourses to the neo-liberal myth that you are to blame for your unemployment,’ said Friedli. ‘At the same time, it undermines and erodes alternative frameworks around which people can come together in solidarity to act against the social causes of worklessness.’ In short, psycho-compulsion not only pathologises and punishes a claimant’s dissent, it depoliticises the causes of joblessness (which discourages collective action), and it does so by resuscitating Margaret Thatcher’s earlier myth that unemployment can be reduced to character deficiencies.

‘What concerns me most about all of this,’ said Heinemeyer, ‘is that the role of schools has always been to prepare young people for the economy – giving them the skills and qualities needed to thrive in the world they are entering. Yet that world today is a world of precarity, where there are no jobs for life, flatlining wages, too many zero-hour or short-term contracts.’ Resilience training therefore becomes about developing the thick skin necessary to survive in inauspicious circumstances. ‘And this is the problem as I see it,’ she continued. ‘At the moment our education system works to maintain this state of affairs by normalising these social realities – toughening kids up to bear them. But the system shouldn’t just serve the economy. It should model an alternative so young people can understand there is another way of doing things.’

In the end, it is the ability of mental health interventions to obscure the social roots of distress that perhaps casts their longest shadow. An essential part of any remedy is learning to understand and critically assess the wider forces holding us back. We must accept that for many children, the truest and most effective therapy won’t be found in a pill, a consultancy room or a classroom intervention, but in loving and meaningful human relationships that endeavour to mitigate the harsher social forces and impacts that they neither perceive nor understand.

The conflict began midway through Kefauver’s time as chair of a government committee overseeing corporate fraud, consumer rights and fair competition in US industry, when he was handed some information alleging fraudulent practices occurring on a wide scale in the pharmaceutical industry. Such was the compelling nature of the supporting evidence that his committee committed to undertake the first ever congressional inquiry into the behaviour of US pharmaceutical companies. As the inquiry unfolded over a period of three years, a worrying picture slowly emerged. Kefauver’s hearings revealed that companies were marketing new drugs as dramatic breakthroughs, even though such drugs showed no improvement over medicines already on the market. It revealed that they were engaged in frenzied advertising campaigns designed to sell trade-name versions of drugs that could otherwise be prescribed under generic names at a fraction of the cost.1 But worse still, they were being allowed to make excessive profits by bringing drugs to market without having to provide any evidence for their efficacy. As it stood, the government in effect had little authority to enforce either good manufacturing practices or the effective testing of drugs. The absence of any regulation in this area meant that billions could be made from prescribed drugs that possessed no medicinal value at all, or at worst, were harmful to patients.

At the time Kefauver’s congressional inquiry was being conducted, a disturbing epidemic had begun spreading across Europe. Increasing numbers of babies were being born with severe limb-reduction defects – their hands and feet emerging directly from their torsos – disabilities that often caused extreme pain and were regularly accompanied by early death. Oddly, this epidemic appeared to be mainly affecting babies in Western Europe, while those in Eastern Europe were escaping relatively unscathed. Germany was by far the worst-affected area, leading to theories that the epidemic could be the product of chemical warfare programmes unleashed by the Soviet Union. But as cases began emerging in countries far from the Soviet Bloc (Japan, Australia, Brazil, west Africa), alternative theories soon gained momentum: perhaps the defects were due to unknown toxins, impure water, undetected parasites, even surreptitious nuclear testing. The theories mounted, but nothing seemed to fit, and all the while the number of children being maimed – now in their many thousands – continued to rise. At the height of the crisis, an unknown German paediatrician called Widukind Lenz grew increasingly distressed as more and more babies in his own surgery presented with the disabilities. As a result, he embarked upon a study of his own, carefully inspecting the lives of 46 women whose children had been born with the painful deformities. He took extensive histories of the women to try to identify any factors linking them. After a long and painstaking analysis, one factor finally emerged: around 80 per cent of the women with affected children had been taking a particular antidepressant and insomnia drug during their pregnancy. Furthermore, when Lenz compared this 80 per cent with a large cohort of women who had not taken the drug during pregnancy, finding that none of their babies had been affected, he believed that he’d found the common link.

It took another physician, located over ten thousand miles away in Australia, who published research supportive of Lenz’s work in The Lancet, to convince the medical community that an allegedly safe and effective antidepressant and insomnia pill was at the root of the tragedy. The pill – innocuously small, white and round – is now infamously known as thalidomide.

During Hinchliffe’s tenure on the Health Select Committee, many parliamentarians, on both sides of the House, were becoming increasingly concerned that healthcare in the UK was being unduly manipulated by pharmaceutical industry interests. ‘I was hearing that we’d been hijacked by the industry in ways that were not in the interests of patients and the public,’ he said, ‘in ways contrary to the values of medicine.’ As others on the committee began to learn more about highly self-interested harmful pharmaceutical industry influence, they unanimously agreed to launch an inquiry into the industry’s influence on medicine – the first undertaken anywhere in the world since Kefauver’s over forty years earlier. Over a series of months, the committee cast its net wide, collating evidence and consulting expert witnesses from the health professions, Parliament, academia, the pharmaceutical industry, the media, patient organisations, medical charities and relevant government departments and agencies.10 The ensuing report was as thorough and far-reaching as its results were damning. In short, it revealed that the pharmaceutical industry was aggressively advertising drugs to prescribers on a large scale, while often offering misleading information that downplayed harms and overplayed benefits. It was making significant payments (speaker’s fees, consultancy fees and other honoraria) to so-called independent medical doctors, largely for marketing purposes. Likewise, it was offering promotional hospitality masquerading as education, while financially backing so-called independent patient groups and medical education programmes supportive of its products. The industry was also engaging in dubious research practices: ‘We heard allegations that clinical trials were not adequately designed – that they could be designed to show the new drug in the best light – and sometimes failed to indicate the true effects of a medicine on health outcomes relevant to the patient,’ said the report. ‘We were informed of several high-profile cases of suppression of trial results. We also heard of selective publication strategies and ghost-writing.’11

It took the events of 2008 to bring that delusion to its knees, when deregulation was exposed as the single most important factor in igniting the most serious economic crisis (at that point at least) since the Great Depression. It had allowed a culture of frenzied and fraudulent behaviour to become endemic in the global financial sector – banks, credit rating agencies, government agencies, regulatory agencies and accountancy firms had all become so financially intertwined and interdependent that recklessness and corrupt behaviour had become almost normalised. Revolving-door policies and financial conflicts of interest were endemic, resulting in lax oversight or just woeful regulatory enforcement; failings from which we all (or at least most of us) are still suffering today. And problems have been uncovered in other deregulated industries too: in the car industry, companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes and Opel-Vauxhall were found to be manipulating emissions data or simply gaming lax regulations.28 In the energy sector, big providers were accused of price fixing, to the financial detriment of consumers.29 In the food industry, there were cover-ups regarding additives causing child hyperactivity, and the toxic effects of aspartame and acrylamide.30 In these and so many other instances, regulators were found to be too close to their respective industries (both financially and interpersonally) to be always trustworthy – they were either denying corporate misconduct, acting too slowly when it was exposed or just showing themselves to be impotent before powerful industrial interests and a competitive regulatory sector.

As suffering is transformed into a market opportunity, it is stripped of its deeper meaning and purposefulness. It is no longer seen as a crucial call to active change, or as the organism’s protest against harmful or traumatic conditions, or as anything potentially transformative or instructive. Rather, it becomes an occasion for yet more consumption and market activity, with an array of industries thriving on the basis of this logic, offering self-interested explanations and solutions for the many pains of living.

‘I remember talking to the protesters about the terrible wave of farmer suicides that have blighted central India over the last fifteen years,’ she continued. ‘I explained how these suicides were related to the promotion of new farming practices by huge agricultural multinational companies.’ These companies were replacing traditional crops with genetically modified plants that don’t produce any seeds. At the same time they were patenting the seeds that were available, so that local famers could no longer continue to save their seeds for next year’s crop. This made the farmers dependent on the multinationals as they now had to buy expensive new plants each year, which put many of them into crushing debt and poverty. ‘Hundreds of thousands of farmers were killing themselves under the resulting stress,’ China said, ‘mostly by drinking toxic pesticide.’

Indeed, as Giles Fraser put it to me: ‘Capitalism doesn’t want your inner life to be completely fixed – it is happy for you to be a functional depressive or a functional alcoholic, because in both instances you are still a functional consumer and that’s what really matters.’ In this sense, the preferred emotional state for late capitalism is a state of perpetual ‘functional dissatisfaction’: functional to the extent that you will continue to work, and dissatisfied to the extent that you will continue to spend.1 Late capitalism does not generate just the conditions of distress, but the materialist, apolitical and profitable interventions deemed to remedy it – interventions that, as we will now see, chime with the materialist zeitgeist of our times.

To illustrate the psychological harms of materialism, Fromm spoke eloquently of what he called ‘the having mode of living’ – something that had always been part of human experience, but which had become unnaturally exaggerated under late capitalism. Under the pressures of modern life, we had all variously succumbed to the over-valuation of buying and consuming things. Those of us who had ended up predominantly in this mode of living had ceased to relate to consumption in any kind of rational way. Instead, we had come to derive our identity and self-esteem largely through what we owned and possessed – believing that we principally defined and created ourselves through the objects we consumed, and that by acquiring more high-status possessions we somehow increased our value and worth as persons.

The more we owned and the more we had, the more we believed we were. It was in this sense that Fromm declared that the primary goal for most people under late capitalism was to have much, rather than to be much.4

While the ‘having mode of living’, encouraged by late capitalism, exerts powerful influence over many of us, Fromm distinguished it from other more authentic ways of existing in the world, in particular from what he called the ‘being mode of living’ – a mode of life whose essential orientation is rooted in developing and using our unique human potentialities, our talents and powers, to their fullest extent. As he said: ‘The mode of being [unlike the mode of having] has as its prerequisites independence, freedom, and the presence of critical reason. Its fundamental characteristic is that of being active, not in the sense of outward activity, of busyness, but of inner activity, the productive use of our human powers. To be active means to give expression to one’s faculties, talents, to the wealth of human gifts with which – though in varying degrees – every human being is endowed.’6

But this was not the message that Kasser intended. And this, I think, is the important bit. Tim Kasser’s work never demonstrated that materialism was the primary cause of bad relationships, emotional insecurity, poor mental health and so on. His research rather revealed something subtler than that: that it went hand in hand with these undesirables. Kasser pointed out that being materialistic or ‘living in the having mode’, as Erich Fromm had described it, did not cause poor mental health but was rather its outcome. To put it differently, materialism appeared to be a kind of disingenuous attempt to manage high levels of personal distress – a harmful coping mechanism that consumerist society encouraged and exploited. The distress itself, he argued, was rather rooted in other more fundamental human deprivations, such as many of our vital human needs sitting unfulfilled. If our basic needs were neglected (our need for safety, economic security, loving connection, autonomy, self-realisation and meaningful work; our need to feel equal and respected), then poor emotional well-being would be the inevitable result. Materialism was therefore an unhelpful response to various deprivations – a culturally endorsed coping mechanism that ultimately backfired.

The play on materialist tropes when promoting antidepressants has been a key feature of pharmaceutical marketing campaigns, which have, in a period of rising materialism, actively promoted material explanations for increasing levels of distress. The early mental health anti-stigma campaigns, for instance, which were largely funded and promoted by the pharmaceutical industry, marketed positive images of psychiatric drugs alongside biological understandings of emotional distress.24 Behind the guise of tackling public stigma, these campaigns encouraged people to seek biological solutions (pills) for their depression.25 By using biological ideas to make their pills a more attractive option, pharmaceutical companies had discovered not only a powerful way to increase sales, but a potent narrative with considerable appeal to an increasingly materialistic population. Acts of consumption were no longer restricted to improving your outer life and image; they were now being marketed as altering and improving the very dynamics of your deeper self.

solving the productivity problem became a key rationale for many of the policy initiatives introduced by Thatcher and Reagan, such as curbing wage growth through de-unionisation (making people work harder for less), boosting competition through more privatisation (making people work harder to keep their jobs) and establishing ‘work incentives’ through reduced welfare provision (making losing your job a far more dangerous prospect). This suite of measures was instituted to nudge our hearts and souls in the supposedly more productive direction new capitalism demanded.10 At the same time as this new economic ideology took over, the culture of the mental health professions transformed too, moving in a far less humanistic direction. The psychiatric profession in particular would come to emphasise the importance of our performing optimally at work. This change can be traced to the very year that Reagan became president: 1980. This was the year when psychiatry’s centrepiece, DSM-III, began medicalising, for the first time in its history, workplace underperformance. This vastly influential diagnostic manual, which I discussed in the introduction, would no longer see distress as a protest against bad circumstances, as the humanists did, but as ‘a behavioural, psychological or biological dysfunction in the person’11 – one that also significantly threatened our productivity at work.

These changes to DSM now gave many mental health organisations a potent economic rationale with which to lobby government and the corporate world for financial support. The big sell was that while governments would raise productivity through social policy, mental health interventions would work on our subjectivity, increasing productivity by altering our internal states. The pharmaceutical companies in particular embraced this new message, by commissioning and/or conducting studies that linked low worker productivity with poor mental health – a malady, they implied, that their drugs could correct. In influential reports funded by the drug company Eli Lilly in the 1990s, for example, depression was cast as posing substantial losses to employers, who must therefore ‘invest in the treatment of this widespread problem’.14

Young, who had become as enchanted with Egypt’s common people as with its ancient monuments, was appalled by the new British suzerains’ contemptuous attitude towards both. “The Englishman,” he observed, “looks upon these people as his hewers of wood and drawers of water, whose duty is to work and to thank the Lord when they are not flogged. They only regard these monuments [meanwhile] as reservoirs from which they can supply their own museums and for that purpose they have plundered Egypt, just as Lord Elgin plundered Greece.” Young noted the crushing burden that the country’s enormous foreign debt, now policed by the British, placed upon its poorest and now famished people. The ex-President, for his part, was annoyed by the insouciant attitude of the local bureaucrats confronted with a disaster of such magnitude.5

But while the Dickensian slum remains in the world history curriculum, the famine children of 1876 and 1899 have disappeared. Almost without exception, modern historians writing about nineteenth-century world history from a metropolitan vantage-point have ignored the late Victorian mega-droughts and famines that engulfed what we now call the “third world.” Eric Hobsbawm, for example, makes no allusion in his famous trilogy on nineteenth-century history to the worst famines in perhaps 500 years in India and China, although he does mention the Great Hunger in Ireland as well as the Russian famine of 1891–92. Likewise, the sole reference to famine in David Landes’s The Wealth and Poverty of Nations—a magnum opus meant to solve the mystery of inequality between nations—is the erroneous claim that British railroads eased hunger in India.18 Numerous other examples could be cited of contemporary historians’ curious neglect of such portentous events. It is like writing the history of the late twentieth century without mentioning the Great Leap Forward famine or Cambodia’s killing fields. The great famines are the missing pages—the absent defining moments, if you prefer—in virtually every overview of the Victorian era.

We not are dealing, in other words, with “lands of famine” becalmed in stagnant backwaters of world history, but with the fate of tropical humanity at the precise moment (1870–1914) when its labor and products were being dynamically conscripted into a London-centered world economy.19 Millions died, not outside the “modern world system,” but in the very process of being forcibly incorporated into its economic and political structures. They died in the golden age of Liberal Capitalism; indeed, many were murdered, as we shall see, by the theological application of the sacred principles of Smith, Bentham and Mill.

The great Victorian famines were forcing houses and accelerators of the very socio-economic forces that ensured their occurrence in the first place. A key thesis of this book is that what we today call the “third world” (a Cold War term)32 is the outgrowth of income and wealth inequalities—the famous “development gap”—that were shaped most decisively in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when the great non-European peasantries were initially integrated into the world economy. As other historians have recently pointed out, when the Bastille was being stormed, the vertical class divisions inside the world’s major societies were not recapitulated as dramatic income differences between societies. The differences in living standards, say, between a French sans-culotte and Deccan farmer were relatively insignificant compared to the gulf that separated both from their ruling classes.33 By the end of Victoria’s reign, however, the inequality of nations was as profound as the inequality of classes. Humanity had been irrevocably divided. And the famed “prisoners of starvation,” whom “The Internationale” urges to arise, were as much modern inventions of the late Victorian world as electric lights, Maxim guns and “scientific” racism.

As we shall see, the most devastating nineteenth-century droughts were decisively preconditioned by landscape degradation, the neglect of traditional irrigation systems, the demobilization of communal labor, and/or the failure of the state to invest in water storage. This is why I agree with Rolando Garcia’s assertion in Nature Pleads Not Guilty (a landmark study of the early 1970s Sahelian crisis) that “climatic facts are not facts in themselves; they assume importance only in relation to the restructuring of the environment within different systems of production.”

Famine (Causality) Whether or not crop failure leads to starvation, and who, in the event of famine, starves, depends on a host of nonlinear social factors. Simple FAD (food availability decline), as Nobel laureate Amartya Sen calls it, may directly lead to famine in isolated hunter-gatherer ecologies, but it is unlikely do so in any large-scale society. Although distant observers of the famines described in this book, including government ministers and great metropolitan papers, regularly described millions killed off by drought or crop failure, those on the scene always knew differently. From the 1860s, or even earlier, it was generally recognized in India, both by British administrators and Indian nationalists, that the famines were not food shortages per se, but complex economic crises induced by the market impacts of drought and crop failure.

Critics have considerably sharpened the teeth of this model. David Arnold, for instance, has usefully warned against excessive demotion of environmental factors, especially the impacts of the nineteenth-century mega-droughts. He has also taxed Sen for ignoring mass extra-legal actions—riots, protests, rebellions—that constitute populist appropriations of entitlement.5 Amarita Rangasami similarly has reminded us that famine “cannot be defined with reference to the victims of starvation alone” In her view (and mine), the great hungers have always been redistributive class struggles: “a process in which benefits accrue to one section of the community while losses flow to the other.”6

All through the autumn of 1876, while the vital kharif crop was withering in the fields of southern India, Lytton had been absorbed in organizing the immense Imperial Assemblage in Delhi to proclaim Victoria Empress of India (Kaiser-i-Hind). As The Times’s special correspondent described it, “The Viceroy seemed to have made the tales of Arabian fiction true … nothing was too rich, nothing too costly.” “Lytton put on a spectacle,” adds a biographer of Lord Salisbury (the secretary of state for India), “which achieved the two criteria Salisbury had set him six months earlier, of being ‘gaudy enough to impress the orientals’ … and furthermore a pageant which hid ‘the nakedness of the sword on which we really rely.’”11 Its “climacteric ceremonial” included a week-long feast for 68,000 officials, satraps and maharajas: the most colossal and expensive meal in world history.12 An English journalist later estimated that 100,000 of the Queen-Empress’s subjects starved to death in Madras and Mysore in the course of Lytton’s spectacular durbar.13 Indians in future generations justifiably would remember him as their Nero.14

Temple was a shrewd choice as Lytton’s enforcer. Earlier, in 1873–74, he had followed Salisbury’s urgings and dealt aggressively with a drought that severely damaged the harvest throughout most of Bengal and Bihar. Importing half a million tons of rice from Burma, he provided life-saving subsistence, both through relief works and a “gratuitous dole,” which forestalled mass mortality. Indeed, the official record claimed only twenty-three starvation deaths. It was the only truly successful British relief effort in the nineteenth century and might have been celebrated as a template for dealing with future emergencies. Instead, Temple came under withering fire from London for the “extravagance” of allowing “the scale of wages paid at relief works had to be determined by the daily food needs of the labourer and the prevailing food prices in the market rather than by the amount that the Government afford to spend for the purpose.”41 In public, he was lambasted by the Economist for encouraging indolent Indians to believe that “it is the duty of the Government to keep them alive.”42 Senior civil servants, convinced (according to Lord Salisbury) that it was “a mistake to spend to spend so much money to save a lot of black fellows,” denounced the relief campaign as “pure Fourierism.”43 Temple’s career was almost ruined.

The final blow against the Deccan peasantry was a militarized campaign to collect the tax arrears accumulated during the drought. The government ruthlessly picked the pockets of paupers.100 In the Kurnool district of Madras, for example, “in 1879–80, coercive policies had to be employed for the recovery of as much as 78% of total collections.” As D. Rajasekhar points out, the resulting auction of lands in arrears may have been a windfall for rich peasants and moneylenders, who had already profited from famine-induced sacrifice sales of cattle and land mortgages, but it crippled the recovery of an agrarian economy that traditionally upon the energy of (now ruined) smallholders to bring cultivable wastes under plough.101

From Fortaleza alone, he was reputed to have sold at least fifteen thousand slaves south.” This sudden revival on a grand scale of the slave trade, with all the brutal public spectacles that accompanied it, provoked enormous public resentment, particularly in Ceará where emancipation societies formed in virtually every town. Within six years, popular agitation had not only ended slavery in Ceará, the first province to do so, but sparked similar crusades across the Northeast. Four years later, in the final twilight of the old Empire, slavery was abolished throughout Brazil.96

Drought and famine gave foreign creditors, allied with indigenous moneylenders and compradores, new opportunities to tighten control over local rural economies through debt or outright expropriation. Pauperized countrysides likewise provided rich harvests of cheap plantation labor as well as missionary converts and orphans to be raised in the faith. And where native states retained their independence, the widespread subsistence crises in Asia and Africa invited a new wave of colonial expansion that was resisted in many cases by indigenous millenarianism. El Niño was thus followed by gunboats and messiahs as well as by famine and disease.

The drought crisis, which weakened both African and Afrikaans societies as well as increasing the tensions between them, was an undisguised blessing to imperial planners in London. Since 1875, Disraeli and his colonial secretary, Lord Carnarvon, had been committed to a “Confederation Scheme” that envisioned a single British hegemony over the southern cone of Africa. “Carnarvon’s design,” according to Cain and Hopkins, “was to turn central Africa and Mozambique into labour reserves for the mines and farms of the south.”36 The discovery of the great Kimberley diamond pipes had overnight made South Africa a major arena for capitalist investment, but the British were stymied by the lack of control over African labor, a problem that was considered insuperable as long as militarily independent African societies continued to exist on the periphery of the diamond fields.37 Thus from his arrival in South Africa in March 1877, Carnarvon’s special high commissioner Sir Bartle Frere (a former governor of Bombay) moved with extraordinary energy to impose British power on the drought-weakened Bantus and Boers alike.

In the most drought-stricken regions, the harvest was utterly lost; elsewhere it was poor at best. The loss of seed ensured a poor yield the following year as well. Meanwhile, the lack of water and grass threatened to decimate the native herds; the interior tribes were forced to sell their animals to livestock dealers at dirt-cheap prices. Exports of sheep doubled while wheat and barley exports fell by half; likewise Algeria, which had exported 17,996 head of beef in the three years from 1874 to 1876, exported 143,198 head between 1877 and 1879. In order to avoid starvation, Algerians liquidated their only real wealth: their livestock.55 In his magisterial history of colonial Algeria, Charles-Robert Ageron has shown how the drought of 1877–81 battened upon and, in turn, accelerated the general tendency of indigenous pauperization. After the defeat of the Muqrani uprising of 1871–72, the Third Republic relentlessly extended the scope of colon capitalism through massive expropriations of communal land, enclosures of forests and pastures, persecution of transhumance, and the ratcheting up of land revenues.

The Great Drought of the 1870s was merely Act One in a three-act world tragedy. Millions more, likely tens of millions, would die during global El Niño droughts in 1888–91 and especially in 1896–1902. There was first, however, a famous interlude of agricultural expansion and relative prosperity. The decade after the end of famine in 1878–9 was characterized by well-distributed, plentiful rainfall and abundant harvests in both hemispheres. It was the Age of Wheat.

When villagers attempted to hold onto their grain, fearing that famine prices would soon exceed the export merchants’ purchase price, they were in some cases beaten or coerced by agents of Ralley Brothers & Company. On the other hand, as creditors foreclosed on farms, some smallholders chose pre-emptive violence over pauperization. A Rawalpindi paper, quoted by Singh, reported that “it has become a common practice with the zamindars to get rid of a creditor by murdering him if he presses for payments of debts.” The “price famine” in the Punjab seemed to be leading to much larger clashes when heavy rainfall in October 1891 ended the drought.

In Russia, poor harvests during the dry years of 1888–90 were prelude to the catastrophic drought in spring and summer of 1891 that brought famine to the black soil provinces of the Volga valley as well as the Orenburg wheat-belt south of the Urals (epicenter of drought during the 1997–98 El Niño). Seventy percent of the rye crop, the chief subsistence of the muzhiks, was lost. As was so frequently the case in India, the tax collector had previously stripped peasant households of any savings in money or grain. Still staggering under the financial burden of their redemption payments from serfdom, peasants in 1891 also struggled to cope with the punitive tax offensive, launched in 1887 by finance minister Vyshnegradskii, that aimed to force them to export more grain. (“Nedoedim no vyvezem—We may not eat enough, but we will export” was the official slogan.) As a result, a majority of rural communes (obshchinas) were essentially insolvent and “even before the disastrous harvest of 1891,” writes Richard Robbins, “many of the signs associated with famine had begun to appear.” Local priests, zemstvo physicians and visiting scientists had all warned of appalling poverty and widespread near-starvation.28

Unlike British India a few years later, however, the government of the soon-to-be-assassinated Czar Alexander III was able to prevent outright starvation. Although there was widespread criticism of the incompetence of zemstvo institutions, the disorganization of public-works initiatives, and the additional financial burden of the loans forced on the peasantry, the official relief campaign succeeded in keeping the death rate in the affected provinces from increasing more than a single percentage point (from 3.76 percent in 1881–90 to 4.81 percent in 1892). By contrast, much vaunted British efforts during the famines of 1896–97 and 1899–1900 were accompanied by mortality spikes of 20 percent or higher. Most of the 400,000 to 600,000 victims in European Russia were killed by typhus and cholera spread by famine refugees rather than by starvation per se.29

In addition, wrote a contemporary economist, “the historic conditions controlling production and distribution … had been revolutionised.”2 The integration of Burma’s huge rice surpluses into the imperial system, along with the 10,000 miles of new railroad track (much of it financed by the Famine Fund), were heralded as providing the rural population with a decisive margin of food security.3 “Famine in the original sense of the word, that is to say as a result of a lack of food, has become impossible. In case of shortfalls, Burma feeds the Punjab and the North Western Provinces or vice versa; Madras comes to the aid of Bombay or the other way around.”4 As Lord Elgin reassured Queen Victoria: “The improvement of the means of communications particularly by railway makes it possible to cope with scarcity now in a way that was out of the power of the officers of former days.”5 In the event, these improvements were all but meaningless. Even his worst enemies marveled at Lord Elgin’s singlemindedness in following Lytton’s path to exactly the same calamitous destination.6 A severely deficient monsoon prevented the sowing of the spring 1896 crop throughout the Punjab, North Western Provinces, Oudh, Bihar and the Madras Deccan. The failure of the rains was even more devastating in the Central Provinces and eastern Rajputana (Rajasthan), where three years of bad weather and poor harvests had already immiserated the peasantry. Throughout India grain prices rose, then skyrocketed after the autumn monsoon likewise failed. Grain reserves, especially in the wheat belt of northern India, had been depleted by massive exports to make up the previous year’s terrible harvest in England.7 Meanwhile Elgin’s “revolutionary” improvements in distribution simply ensured that prices were as high in districts unaffected by the drought (like the well-watered Godavari Delta in Madras) as in those where most of the crop had failed.8

When the government’s actual relief expenditures were published a year later, they fell far below the per capita recommendations of the 1880 Famine Commission. As a new Famine Commission reported in 1898: “Our general conclusion is that, as compared with the past, a considerable degree of success as regards economy had been attained in the relief measures of the late famine.”71

The relief works were quickly shut down with the return of the rains in 1898. Hundreds of thousands of destitute, landless people, without any means to take immediate advantage of the monsoon, were pushed out of the camps and poorhouses. As a consequence, the momentum of famine and disease continued to generate a staggering 6.5 million excess deaths in 1898, making total mortality closer to 11 million than the 4.5 million earlier admitted by Elgin. Twelve to 16 million was the death toll commonly reported in the world press, which promptly nominated this as the “famine of the century.”72 This dismal title, however, was almost immediately usurped by the even greater drought and deadlier famine of 1899–1902.

Rural India, moreover, was still economically prostrate from the 1896–97 disaster. Ryots could not afford to deepen their wells to reach lowered water tables. “The people,” wrote a Hyderabad Methodist, “had no reserves either of strength or grain to fall back on, the debts of the previous famine still hung around their necks, money was impossible to get, for lenders tightened their purse strings when they saw no chance of recovering their loans.”82 “Three years ago at the end of the famine,” added another missionary from the Bombay Deccan, “there was less wretchedness and starvation than I saw here today at the beginning of the famine … This famine is undoubtedly more severe in these parts than that of ’76 or that of ’96.”83 What surplus had been harvested in 1898 had been punctually confiscated by the moneylenders and tax-collectors. In the Punjab, for example, “the agreeable harvest of kharif of 1897 and rabi of 1898 had been largely drawn on to pay up arrears of government dues and to pay the banias for their overdrawn accounts of the famine years.”84

Owing to the excellent system of communications which now brings every portion of the Presidency into close connexion with the great market, the supplies of food were at all times sufficient, and it cannot be too frequently repeated that severe privation was chiefly due to the dearth of employment in agriculture and other industries, but the failure of the harvests caused loss of ordinary income in an enormous area and to an “unprecedented extent”… Even the skilled artisan felt the pinch of high prices. Other classes too have suffered severely. The mill industry was much hampered by short stocks and consequently high price of cotton, and several factories were obliged to work short hours: the result has been depression …85

In the Bombay Presidency alone, the government boasted that the tests had deterred 1 million people from relief.91 Like Lytton twenty years before, Curzon would become the architect of a “brilliantly organized famine.”

In the midst of this carnage, the viceroy, breaking precedent with previous governments, decided to deport refugees who had fled into British India from neighboring native states. Of an estimated 85 million drought victims, 43 million lived in native states and 42 million were under direct British administration.106 As Curzon unquestionably understood, deportation was a virtual death sentence for hundreds of thousands of desperate people. The 688 native states, some of them literally microscopic, were puppet governments with dependent economies and subsidized rulers. If, in some notable instances, native princes (like the Maharajah of Kholapur or Prince Ranjitsinh of Jamnagar, the famous cricket hero) upheld more humanitarian, pre-British traditions of dignified relief and tax forgiveness, others—their power subvented by the Raj—simply turned their backs on their famished subjects.107 The worst offenders included Indore, where the maharaja, a bottom-line man like Curzon, vetoed all relief expenditures, and Bundi, in southeast Rajputana, where the rajah let half his subjects starve to death.

Although nearly a million villagers eventually died in the native and British-administered sectors of Rajputana, grain traders earned immense profits as they shifted rice and millet stocks from the countryside to the cities. Foreign observers were shocked by the obscene contrast. An American missionary, for example, wrote of his repulsion at the sight of vast quantities of grain, imported by speculators, sitting on railroad sidings under armed guard. “At many of the railway stations I saw thousands of fat pigeons gorging themselves with grain from the loaded wagons on the siding, while apathetic native officials stood by and saw the precious food devoured in the sight of scores of miserable, famine-stricken villagers crying aloud for food.”109

As famine waxed in intensity, the government in Bombay decided to milk this “soft man” and his family of their last reserves. “The revenue,” it was announced, “must at all costs be gathered in”—a decision denounced by Nash as “picking the bones of the people.”128 When patidar farmers, ruined by the drought, combined to refuse a 24 percent increase in their tax payment, the collectors simply confiscated their land.129 Officials in the Central Provinces (where 500,000 died in 1900 alone) were equally ruthless.130 The corruption and incompetence of the Provinces’ poor houses contrasted with the efficiency of its militarized revenue campaign. “In the Narmada division, where famine was more intense, it [the government] employed more savage coercion than in the better year 1898–99. Rounding off a terrifying decade, officials claimed near full collections in most districts in 1900–01.”131

The Bombay authorities were forced to keep relief works open almost until Christmas 1902. As in 1877 and 1897, “the main peak in the famine death rate … occurred relatively late,” coinciding with the return of monsoon rains in August–September 1900 in the Central Provinces and a malaria epidemic that ravaged the weakened and immune-suppressed population.133 The India Office estimated famine mortality in British India 1899–1900 as 1.25 million, not counting malaria deaths, but Indian economists led by R. C. Dutt claimed that it “was actually three or four times this.”134 In a recent statistical reconstruction, demographer Arup Maharatna suggests a mortality range (not including 1901–02 victims ) of between 3 and 4.4 million, although Burton Stein believes that the true figure was closer to 6.5 million and W. Arthur Lewis cites 10 million dead.135 Certainly the uncounted dead in the native states and the heavy mortality through 1902 suggest a total comparable to that of the 1870s catastrophe, making nonsense of Curzon’s claim that “there had never been a famine when the general mortality has been less, when the distress has been more amply or swiftly relieved.”136

And what lesson did the British draw from these catastrophes? The most comprehensive official survey, the Report on the Famine in Bombay Presidency, 1899–1902, conceded that much of the excess mortality might have been avoided by “widespread gratuitous [home] relief from the beginning,” but insisted that “the cost could have been such as no country would bear or should be called upon to bear” (although both the Moguls and the Qing provided this form of relief during the eighteenth century). Likewise the principal finding of the Report of the 1901 [all-India] Famine Commission—despite the fact that barely a fifth of estimated famine victims received any British assistance whatsoever—was that “the relief distributed was excessive.”149

The tragedy was made all the more bitter by the universal belief among the people that the disaster was man-made and avoidable. “Breaches of the Yellow River dikes had been occurring for several years as a consequence of embezzlement of flood control funds by officials of all ranks … The censors in their impeachment memorials had reported this corrupt administration of the Yellow River Conservancy for many years.”12 The chief culprit, the pro-Catholic head of the Conservancy, had been dismissed for his venality, but was restored to power under pressure from the French. The hungry and half-drowned peasantry, according to Esherick, presumed that “this official, brought back at foreign insistence, was through his incompetence and corruption responsible for the great flood.”13

Joining the Boxers, moreover, was a sure way of filling one’s belly. Everywhere the movement was active it patriotically cajoled, or if necessary, simply expropriated surplus food from merchants and rich peasants. More violently, it seized and divided the foodstocks of Christian villages and missions. Wanguo gongbao, the missionary newspaper founded by Timothy Richard, warned that while the “weak topple in the roadside ditches … the stronger become outlaws [and] advocate dividing the wealth among rich and poor.”26 Indeed, most accounts agree, the radical slogan “equal division of grain” was central to the explosive growth of the Boxer uprising.

As oral histories gathered in the late 1940s and early 1960s by PRC historians have corroborated, the Boxer Uprising was an extraordinarily broad-based, popular movement. “Sympathy for the Boxer cause appeared almost universal in the villages of the north China plain,” and “county after county reported boxing rounds as numerous as ‘trees in a forest.’”37 By contrast, last-minute Manchu support from the cabal around the dowager-empress was wavering and ineffective, while the commercial elites of the Yangzi Delta, untouched by famine, acquiesced in foreign intervention with little risk of popular censure. In the end, the courage of the Boxers and Red Lanterns (their female counterparts), armed with little more than sticks and magic charms, was magnificent but of little avail in stationary battles against the combined forces of the Great Powers. To the millions of deaths in North China from famine and epidemic between 1897 and 1901 were added hundreds of thousands of additional casualties from the exterminating armies of Field-Marshal Von Waldersee (personally ordered by the Kaiser to emulate the carnage of Atila) and the other foreign victors.

Falsely portrayed by his enemies (and, more recently, by Mario Vargas Llosa) as a raving monster, Conselheiro’s “dark, unforgiving Catholicism,” as Robert Levine has shown, was not unorthodox by traditional standards of the Nordeste. Unlike Cícero, he was not an impresario of miracles, nor did he encourage a cult around himself or perform sacraments. He may have been the sertão’s Savonarola or Cotton Mather, but he was not its “messiah.” His sermons were typically based on popular missionary tracts, focusing on penitential devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows. Even his interpretation of the recurrent droughts from 1889 on as harbingers of the end of the world was fully in accord with the passionate vision of much of the regular clergy in the Northeast. On the other hand, when Conselheiro’s fierce biblical rectitude crossed into the terrain of politics he was branded as a subversive. His “intense feelings about social justice,” especially his opposition to slavery and the exploitation of the poor, led him to advocate nonviolent civic and religious disobedience. In the course of his two decades of spiritual peregrination he was repeatedly arrested, abused and deported by various local authorities—a persecution that only increased his sanctified stature among the sharecroppers and landless laborers of the sertão.44

This led to a famous investigation into “the declining prosperity of the Javanese people,” conducted from 1902 to 1905 and published in fourteen volumes in 1914, that finally forced the abandonment of a strictly laissez-faire colonial policy. The so-called “Ethical Policy,” as crafted by Alexander Idenburg—variously, the minister of colonies and governor-general of Java—was supposedly based on a new trio of priorities: education, irrigation and emigration. The debate that produced the Ethical Policy has often been favorably contrasted to the obdurate conservatism of the Edwardian Raj. In practice, however, the reforms in Java went hand in hand with the military consolidation of Dutch power in the outer islands (the Dutch, like the Americans in Mindanao, were still mopping up local resistance in the Moluccas and New Guinea until the eve of the First World War.)65 Moreover, “Ethics” did little to reduce the exploitation, or increase the food-security, of ordinary Javanese. Their real impact, rather, was to shift government investment toward the pacified outer islands in support of Royal Dutch Shell and other private interests who were exploiting lucrative oil and rubber bonanzas.66

Then, as drought began to turn into famine in 1900, they authorized the systematic destruction of rice stores and livestock in areas that continued to support guerrilla resistance. As historians would later point out, the ensuing campaign of terror against the rural population, backed up by a pass system and population “reconcentration,” prefigured US strategy in Vietnam during the 1960s. “All palay, rice, and storehouses clearly for use by enemy soldiers,” writes De Bevoise, “were to be destroyed. That plan would have caused hardship for the people even had it been implemented as intended, since guerrillas and civilians often depended on the same rice stockpiles, but the food-denial program got out of hand. Increasingly unsure who was enemy and who was friend, American soldiers on patrol did not agonize over such distinctions. They shot and burned indiscriminately, engaging in an orgy of destruction throughout the Philippines.” As one soldier wrote back home to Michigan: “We burned every house, destroyed every carabao and other animals, all rice and other foods.” As a result, “agricultural production was so generally crippled during the American war that food-surplus regions hardly existed.”70

In central Kenya—where the 1897–99 drought is still recalled today as Yua ya Ngomanisye, “the famine that went everywhere”—the small, autonomous farming societies of the highland margin never rose in revolt against the British, but suffered social disintegration nonetheless. In some areas, the rains failed three years in a row and food reserves that might have arrested famine were depleted to feed railroad construction crews and Uganda-bound safaris. In addition, the bubonic plague, most likely brought from India with coolie labor, was the first passenger on the yet unfinished Uganda Railroad. As a result, according to a white settler, “the railway line was a mass of corpses.”84 Suffering was still intense when Halford Mackinder, the future apostle of imperialist geopolitics, passed down the line in July 1899, en route to a first ascent of Mount Kenya. Noting the “horrible evidence of the famine among the Wakamba,” which had driven some men to raiding, he criticized the railroad police for indiscriminately burning villages in retaliation: “If food is destroyed the famine is made worse, and that is the prime cause of the raids.” He also frowned at the Uganda Railroad’s brutal expropriation of all the farmland in a two-mile-wide corridor along its tracks.85

This generation of disaster forever transfigured African society. Robin Palmer, in his major study of the roots of poverty in southern Africa, contrasts the dynamic village economies of the early 1890s with the “picture of widespread stagnation and decay” thirty years later: the decline in crop diversity and output, the cessation of inter-African trade, and the forced dependence on mine labor or urban migration. “By 1939 virtually all vestiges of African economic independence have been shattered, African cultivators have become tied to a world market over which they have no control, and a pattern of underdevelopment has been firmly established.”99 The colonial state, moreover, deeply entrenched itself in the social inequalities unleased by drought-famine and epidemic disease. The “traditional” chiefs of the late colonial period were often little more than officially sanctioned vultures who had fattened themselves on communal disaster. “Even more striking [than missionary conversions],” writes Ambler of Kenya after 1898, “was the way that the individuals whom the British recognized as ‘chiefs’ were able to accumulate power during the famine. Despite sometimes violent local hostility, a number of such men were able to expand substantially both their livestock herds and their circles of dependents and clients … One woman from a poor background pointed to this process of accumulation with some bitterness: ‘When the people who had gone away came back those rich who had remained tried to keep those returning from owning anything.’”100

Until the Mutiny, the relationship of science to empire was still sufficiently protean that it was possible for savants like Roxburgh to boldly criticize ecological rapine and European exploitation—at least when it was embodied by private monopolies like the East India Company. As late as 1849, surgeon-naturalist successors to Roxburgh, like Edward Balfour in Madras, were still defending his view that famine was “a straightforward consequence of the onset of British colonial rule and revenue policies.”9 By 1876, however, when famine holocausts directly threatened the moral legitimations of empire, tropical science was rapidly being incorporated into colonial bureaucracies like Blanford’s India Meteorological Department. Expanded resources for data collection and analysis were bought at the price of subservience to an ideology that contrasted British Progress to “tragic” Indian Nature.

Taking a more sober approach, Y. Kueh (1998) has used impressive statistical modeling to show that “the weather was the main cause of the enormous grain-yield losses in 1960 and 1961,” but that the communes could still have survived the crisis without mass mortality if Beijing had not stupidly reduced sown acreage in 1959 (to divert labor to public works and backyard steel-making) and criminally enforced confiscatory procurement quotas in 1959–60.43 A hideous culpability (although not the conspiratorial malevolence that Becker alleges) thus falls upon the Maoist leadership. Although drought was again a proximate cause, the truly key variable was the absence of socialist democracy. As Amartya Sen has emphasized in a well-known contrast of postcolonial India and China, “The particular fact that China, despite its much greater achievements in reducing endemic deprivation, experienced a gigantic famine during 1958–61 … had a good deal to do with the lack of press freedom and the absence of political opposition. The disastrous policies that had paved the way of the famine were not changed for three years as the famine raged on, and this was made possible by the near-total suppression of news about the famine and the total absence of media criticism of what was then happening in China.”44

We ideally need, in other words, an analogue for the late Victorian famines in which the natural parameters are constant but the social variables significantly differ. An excellent candidate for which we possess unusually detailed documentation is the El Niño event of 1743–44 (described as “exceptional” by Whetton and Rutherfurd) in its impact on the north China plain.7 Although not as geographically far-reaching as the great ENSO droughts of 1876–78 or 1899–1900, it otherwise prefigured their intensities. The spring monsoon failed two years in a row, devastating winter wheat in Hebei (Zhili) and northern Shandong. Scorching winds withered crops and farmers dropped dead in their fields from sunstroke. Provincial grain supplies were utterly inadequate to the scale of need. Yet unlike the late nineteenth century, there was no mass mortality from either starvation or disease. Why not? Pierre-Etienne Will has carefully reconstructed the fascinating history of the 1743–44 relief campaign from contemporary records. Under the skilled Confucian administration of Fang Guancheng, the agricultural and hydraulic expert who directed relief operations in Zhili, the renowned “ever-normal granaries” in each county immediately began to issue rations (without any labor test) to peasants in the officially designated disaster counties.8

In contrast, moreover, to later Western stereotypes of a passive Chinese state, government during the high Qing era was proactively involved in famine prevention through a broad program of investment in agricultural improvement, irrigation and waterborne transportation. As in other things, Joseph Needham points out, the eighteenth century was a golden age for theoretical and historical work on flood control and canal construction. Civil engineers were canonized and had temples erected in their honor.20 Confucian activists like Guancheng, with a deep commitment to agricultural intensification, “tended to give top priority to investments in infrastructure and to consider the organization of food relief merely a makeshift.” Guancheng also wrote a famous manual (the source of much of Will’s account) that codified historically tested principles of disaster planning and relief management: something else that has little precedent in backward European tradition.21

Finally, there is plentiful evidence that the northern China peasantry during the high Qing was more nutritionally self-reliant and less vulnerable to climate stress than their descendants a century later. In the eighteenth century, after the Kangxi emperor permanently froze land revenue at the 1712 level, China experienced “the mildest agrarian taxation it had ever known in the whole of its history.”22 Dwight Perkins estimates that the formal land tax was a mere 5 to 6 percent of the harvest and that a large portion was expended locally by hsien and provincial governments.

Medick, writing about the analogous predicament of marginal smallholders in “proto-industrial” Europe, provides an exemplary description of the dilemma of millions of Indian and Chinese poor peasants in the late nineteenth century: For them [even] rising agrarian prices did not necessarily mean increasing incomes. Since their marginal productivity was low and production fluctuated, rising agrarian prices tended to be a source of indebtedness rather than affording them the opportunity to accumulate surpluses. The “anomaly of the agrarian markets” forced the marginal subsistence producers into an unequal exchange relationship through the market … Instead of profiting from exchange, they were forced by the market into the progressive deterioration of their conditions of production, i.e. the loss of their property titles. Especially in years of bad harvests, and high prices, the petty producers were compelled to buy additional grain, and, worse, to go into debt. Then, in good harvest years when cereal prices were low, they found it hard to extricate themselves from the previously accumulated debts; owing to the low productivity of their holdings they could not produce sufficient quantities for sale.50

Second, the integration of millions of tropical cultivators into the world market during the late nineteenth century was accompanied by a dramatic deterioration in their terms of trade. Peasants’ lack of market power vis-à-vis crop merchants and creditors was redoubled by their commodities’ falling international purchasing power. The famous Kondratief downswing of 1873–97 made dramatic geographical discriminations. As W. Arthur Lewis suggests, comparative productivity or transport costs alone cannot explain an emergent structure of global unequal exchange that valued the products of tropical agriculture so differently from those of temperate farming. “With the exception of sugar, all the commodities whose price was lower in 1913 than in 1883 were commodities produced almost wholly in the tropics. All the commodities whose prices rose over this thirty-year period were commodities in which the temperate countries produced a substantial part of total supplies. The fall in ocean freight rates affected tropical more than temperate prices, but this should not make a difference of more than five percentage points.”51

The use of force to configure a “liberal” world economy (as Marx and later Rosa Luxemburg argued) is what Pax Britannica was really about. Palmerston paved the way for Cobden. The Victorians, according to Brian Bond’s calculations, resorted to gunboats on at least seventy-five different occasions.69 The simultaneous British triumphs in the Mutiny and the “Arrow” War in 1858, along with Japan’s yielding to Perry in the same year, were the epochal victories over Asian economic autonomy that made a Cobdenite world of free trade possible in the second half of the nineteenth century. (Thailand had already conceded a 3 percent tariff in 1855.70) The Taiping Revolution—“more revolutionary in its aims than the Meiji Restoration, insisting on gender equality and democratizing literacy”—was a gigantic attempt to revise that verdict, and was, of course, defeated only thanks to the resources and mercenaries that Britain supplied to the embattled Qing.71

Paradoxically, monsoon Asia’s most important “moment” in the Victorian world economy was not at the beginning of the epoch, but towards its end. “The full value of British rule, the return on political investments first made in the eighteenth century,” write Cain and Hopkins in their influential history of British imperialism, “was not realised until the second half of the nineteenth century, when India became a vital market for Lancashire’s cotton goods and when other specialised interests, such as jute manufacturers in Dundee and steel producers in Sheffield, also greatly increased their stake in the sub-continent.”73 The coerced levies of wealth from India and China were not essential to the rise of British hegemony, but they were absolutely crucial in postponing its decline.

The operation of this crucial circuit was simple and ingenious. Britain earned huge annual surpluses in her transactions with India and China that allowed her to sustain equally large deficits with the United States, Germany and the white Dominions. True, Britain also enjoyed invisible earnings from shipping, insurance, banking and foreign investment, but without Asia, which generated 73 percent of British trade credit in 1910, Anthony Latham argues, Britain “presumably would have been forced to abandon free trade,” while her trading partners would have been forced to slow their own rates of industrialization. The liberal world economy might otherwise have fragmented into autarkic trading blocs, as it did later during the 1930s: The United States and industrial Europe, in particular Germany, were able to continue their policy of tariff protection only because of Britain’s surplus with Asia. Without that Asian surplus, Britain would no longer have been able to subsidise their growth. So what emerges is that Asia in general, but India and China in particular, far from being peripheral to the evolution of the international economy at this time, were in fact crucial. Without the surpluses which Britain was able to earn there, the whole pattern of international economic development would have been severely constrained.76

Between 1875 and 1900, years that included the worst famines in Indian history, annual grain exports increased from 3 million to 10 million tons: a quantity that, as Romesh Dutt pointed out, was equivalent to the annual nutrition of 25 million people. By the turn of the century, India was supplying nearly a fifth of Britain’s wheat consumption as well as allowing London grain merchants to speculate during shortages on the Continent.86

In addition to being at the losing end of the imperialism of free trade, the Indian and Chinese economies were also throttled by military expenditures and the gold standard. In the Victorian era, no other major countries were forced to devote such excessive portions of their national income to war. India, already saddled with a huge public debt that included reimbursing the stockholders of the East India Company and paying the costs of the 1857 revolt, also had to finance British military supremacy in Asia. In addition to incessant proxy warfare with Russia on the Afghan frontier, ordinary Indians also paid for such far-flung adventures of the Indian Army as the sacking of Beijing (1860), the invasion of Ethiopia (1868), the occupation of Egypt (1882), and the conquest of the Sudan (1896–98). As a result, military expenditures were never less than 25 percent (or 34 percent including police) of India’s annual budget, and viceroys were constantly searching for creative ways to purloin monies for the army from other parts of the budget, even from the Famine Fund. Victorian England, on the other hand, never expended more than 3 percent of its net national product on its army and navy, a serendipitous situation that considerably diminished domestic tensions over imperialism.97

Malthus is still a potent figure among at least the older generation of economic historians. Princeton’s W. Arthur Lewis, one of the leading authorities on the nineteenth-century world economy, assumed as a matter of course in an influential 1978 study that the underlying cause of famine in Victorian India was not the “drain of wealth” to England as alleged by contemporary critics, but “a large population that continued to live at subsistence level on inadequately watered marginal lands, without a profitable cash crop.”113 Similarly, the historiography of late imperial China has been haunted by the spectre of “agricultural involution” and the so-called “high-level equilibrium trap”—both euphemisms for how the presumed population explosion of the eighteenth century squeezed arable land to the threshold of chronic famine.

Likewise contemporary scholars are dramatically revising the traditional image of late imperial China as a “demographic profligate”: the hopeless “Malthusia” depicted by generations of economic theorists and demographers.118 Until recently, most scholars have accepted fragmentary evidence for an eighteenth-century population explosion that doubled or even tripled China’s 1700 population. Demographic reductionists, however, have always had difficulty explaining how population growth that was clearly so “Boserupian” in the eighteenth century (promoting a dynamic expansion of productive forces) could abruptly become so grimly Malthusian in the nineteenth (blocking all advances in productivity). (Esther Boserup, of course, inverted Malthus in a famous 1965 study to argue that population increase was really the motor, not the brake, of economic and social progress.)119 Moreover, there is little evidence for any increase in demographic pressure after the end of the Qing Golden Age. As Maddison points out, China’s population was no higher in 1890 than in 1820 while per capita income was significantly lower.120

Rejecting demographic determinism, of course, does not mean that population regimes played no role in China’s nineteenth-century crisis. On the contrary, it is clear that the very success of agricultural intensification in the Golden Age encouraged excessive subdivision of land in many regions as well as ecologically destructive reclamations of previously uncultivated highlands and wetlands. Moreover, population growth often seems to have been concentrated in the poorest and most environmentally vulnerable areas. Local population–resource relationships will thus figure prominently in subsequent discussions of subsistence crisis and disaster vulnerability in north China. But population growth was hardly the self-acting, archimedean lever of history imagined by so many economic historians.

Mercantile exploitation of the small cultivator was a ubiquitous relation of production, and Baker’s characterization of Tamilnadu undoubtedly can be applied to most of late-Victorian India: “Virtually everyone who realized a surplus from agriculture tried his hand at trade and moneylending, and thus there were many apprentice despots.”59 As we have seen, the moneylenders (at least 500,000 by the 1870s) and wealthy landowners were profoundly anti-developmental for eminently neoclassical reasons. As Washbrook points out, “It became progressively more ‘economically rational’ to sustain accumulation through coercion and the ‘natural’ decline in the share of the social product accorded to labour rather than to put valuable capital at risk by investment.”60 Likewise, Baker adds, “creditors gave out ‘loans’ in order to be able to secure dependents and it would have been foolish to make ‘loans’ which, by improving the productivity of the debtor’s land, helped him to become more independent.”61

One reason women have traditionally gossiped more than men is because gossip has been a social interaction wherein women have felt comfortable stating what they really think and feel. Often, rather than asserting what they think at the appropriate moment, women say what they think will please the listener. Later, they gossip, stating at that moment their true thoughts. This division between a false self invented to please others and a more authentic self need not exist when we cultivate positive self-esteem.

However, if you then explain that we can only end male violence against women by challenging patriarchy, and that means no longer accepting the notion that men should have more rights and privileges than women because of biological difference or that men should have the power to rule over women, that is when the agreement stops.

from its coastal trade.) This abdication of hydraulic control in inland north China was perhaps the most portentous consequence of the growing imperialist pressure on the Qing. “The foreign onslaught,” writes Pomeranz, “destroyed basic principles of Ming-Qing statecraft, particularly a commitment to social reproduction that had often required rich areas to subsidize the infrastructure of poorer ones.

This abdication of hydraulic control in inland north China was perhaps the most portentous consequence of the growing imperialist pressure on the Qing. “The foreign onslaught,” writes Pomeranz, “destroyed basic principles of Ming-Qing statecraft, particularly a commitment to social reproduction that had often required rich areas to subsidize the infrastructure of poorer ones. Instead foreign pressures helped impart a quasi-mercantilist logic to the actions of a state that was struggling to survive. Resources had to be used where they did the most to protect China’s autonomy from direct intervention or the consequences of foreign debt or both.”

Nineteenth-century Brazil, also a subcontinent much visited by El Niño, shared two other things in common with contemporary India. First, while nominally independent, its economy, especially in the Nordeste, was so dominated by English investors and creditors that it has become the classic example of an “informal colony” in modern literature on economic dependency.

Today, the popular version of this story is typically some updated variation on Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind, which he wrote in 1754. Once upon a time, the story goes, we were hunter-gatherers, living in a prolonged state of childlike innocence, in tiny bands. These bands were egalitarian; they could be for the very reason that they were so small. It was only after the ‘Agricultural Revolution’, and then still more the rise of cities, that this happy condition came to an end, ushering in ‘civilization’ and ‘the state’ – which also meant the appearance of written literature, science and philosophy, but at the same time, almost everything bad in human life: patriarchy, standing armies, mass executions and annoying bureaucrats demanding that we spend much of our lives filling in forms.

The problem is that anyone seeking an alternative to this rather depressing view of history will quickly find that the only one on offer is actually even worse: if not Rousseau, then Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes’s Leviathan, published in 1651, is in many ways the founding text of modern political theory. It held that, humans being the selfish creatures they are, life in an original State of Nature was in no sense innocent; it must instead have been ‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’ – basically, a state of war, with everybody fighting against everybody else.

To give just a sense of how different the emerging picture is: it is clear now that human societies before the advent of farming were not confined to small, egalitarian bands. On the contrary, the world of hunter-gatherers as it existed before the coming of agriculture was one of bold social experiments, resembling a carnival parade of political forms, far more than it does the drab abstractions of evolutionary theory. Agriculture, in turn, did not mean the inception of private property, nor did it mark an irreversible step towards inequality. In fact, many of the first farming communities were relatively free of ranks and hierarchies. And far from setting class differences in stone, a surprising number of the world’s earliest cities were organized on robustly egalitarian lines, with no need for authoritarian rulers, ambitious warrior-politicians, or even bossy administrators.

imagine we framed the problem differently, the way it might have been fifty or 100 years ago: as the concentration of capital, or oligopoly, or class power. Compared to any of these, a word like ‘inequality’ sounds like it’s practically designed to encourage half-measures and compromise. It’s possible to imagine overthrowing capitalism or breaking the power of the state, but it’s not clear what eliminating inequality would even mean. (Which kind of inequality? Wealth? Opportunity? Exactly how equal would people have to be in order for us to be able to say we’ve ‘eliminated inequality’?) The term ‘inequality’ is a way of framing social problems appropriate to an age of technocratic reformers, who assume from the outset that no real vision of social transformation is even on the table.

In the Middle Ages, most people in other parts of the world who actually knew anything about northern Europe at all considered it an obscure and uninviting backwater full of religious fanatics who, aside from occasional attacks on their neighbours (‘the Crusades’), were largely irrelevant to global trade and world politics.1 European intellectuals of that time were just rediscovering Aristotle and the ancient world, and had very little idea what people were thinking and arguing about anywhere else. All this changed, of course, in the late fifteenth century, when Portuguese fleets began rounding Africa and bursting into the Indian Ocean – and especially with the Spanish conquest of the Americas. Suddenly, a few of the more powerful European kingdoms found themselves in control of vast stretches of the globe, and European intellectuals found themselves exposed, not only to the civilizations of China and India but to a whole plethora of previously unimagined social, scientific and political ideas. The ultimate result of this flood of new ideas came to be known as the ‘Enlightenment’. Of course, this isn’t usually the way historians of ideas tell this story. Not only are we taught to think of intellectual history as something largely produced by individuals writing great books or thinking great thoughts, but these ‘great thinkers’ are assumed to perform both these activities almost exclusively with reference to each other.

In fact, what we’ll see is not only that indigenous Americans – confronted with strange foreigners – gradually developed their own, surprisingly consistent critique of European institutions, but that these critiques came to be taken very seriously in Europe itself. Just how seriously can hardly be overstated. For European audiences, the indigenous critique would come as a shock to the system, revealing possibilities for human emancipation that, once disclosed, could hardly be ignored. Indeed, the ideas expressed in that critique came to be perceived as such a menace to the fabric of European society that an entire body of theory was called into being, specifically to refute them. As we will shortly see, the whole story we summarized in the last chapter – our standard historical meta-narrative about the ambivalent progress of human civilization, where freedoms are lost as societies grow bigger and more complex – was invented largely for the purpose of neutralizing the threat of indigenous critique.

The first thing to emphasize is that ‘the origin of social inequality’ is not a problem which would have made sense to anyone in the Middle Ages. Ranks and hierarchies were assumed to have existed from the very beginning. Even in the Garden of Eden, as the thirteenth-century philosopher Thomas Aquinas observed, Adam clearly outranked Eve. ‘Social equality’ – and therefore, its opposite, inequality – simply did not exist as a concept. A recent survey of medieval literature by two Italian scholars in fact finds no evidence that the Latin terms aequalitas or inaequalitas or their English, French, Spanish, German and Italian cognates were used to describe social relations at all before the time of Columbus. So one cannot even say that medieval thinkers rejected the notion of social equality: the idea that it might exist seems never to have occurred to them.6 In fact, the terms ‘equality’ and ‘inequality’ only began to enter common currency in the early seventeenth century, under the influence of natural law theory. And natural law theory, in turn, arose largely in the course of debates about the moral and legal implications of Europe’s discoveries in the New World. It’s important to remember that Spanish adventurers like Cortés and Pizarro carried out their conquests largely without authorization from higher authorities; afterwards, there were intense debates back home over whether such unvarnished aggression against people who, after all, posed no threat to Europeans could really be justified.7 The key problem was that – unlike non-Christians of the Old World, who could be assumed to have had the opportunity to learn the teachings of Jesus, and therefore to have actively rejected them – it was fairly obvious that the inhabitants of the New World simply never had any exposure to Christian ideas. So they couldn’t be classed as infidels.

Lallemant’s account gives a sense of just how politically challenging some of the material to be found in the Jesuit Relations must have been to European audiences of the time, and why so many found it fascinating. After expanding on how scandalous it was that even murderers should get off scot-free, the good father did admit that, when considered as a means of keeping the peace, the Wendat system of justice was not ineffective. Actually, it worked surprisingly well. Rather than punish culprits, the Wendat insisted the culprit’s entire lineage or clan pay compensation. This made it everyone’s responsibility to keep their kindred under control. ‘It is not the guilty who suffer the penalty,’ Lallemant explains, but rather ‘the public that must make amends for the offences of individuals.’

But just as we earlier witnessed a confrontation between two very different concepts of equality, here we are ultimately witnessing a clash between very different concepts of individualism. Europeans were constantly squabbling for advantage; societies of the Northeast Woodlands, by contrast, guaranteed one another the means to an autonomous life – or at least ensured no man or woman was subordinated to any other.

Ellingson concluded there never was a ‘noble savage’ myth; at least not in the sense of a stereotype of simple societies living in an age of happy primordial innocence. Rather, travellers’ accounts tend to supply a much more ambivalent picture, describing alien societies as a complicated, sometimes (to them) incoherent, mix of virtues and vices. What needs to be investigated, instead, might better be called the ‘myth of the myth of the noble savage’: why is it that certain Europeans began attributing such a naive position to others? The answer isn’t pretty. The phrase ‘noble savage’ was in fact popularized a century or so after Rousseau, as a term of ridicule and abuse. It was deployed by a clique of outright racists, who in 1859 – as the British Empire reached its height of power – took over the British Ethnological Society and called for the extermination of inferior peoples.

Chiefs found themselves in this situation, Clastres argued, because they weren’t the only ones who were mature and insightful political actors; almost everyone was. Rather than being trapped in some sort of Rousseauian innocence, unable to imagine more complex forms of organization, people were generally more capable than we are of imagining alternative social orders, and therefore had created ‘societies against the state’. They had self-consciously organized in such a way that the forms of arbitrary power and domination we associate with ‘advanced political systems’ could never possibly emerge.

For far too long we have been generating myths. As a result, we’ve been mostly asking the wrong questions: are festive rituals expressions of authority, or vehicles for social creativity? Are they reactionary or progressive? Were our earliest ancestors simple and egalitarian, or complex and stratified? Is human nature innocent or corrupt? Are we, as a species, inherently co-operative or competitive, kind or selfish, good or evil? Perhaps all these questions blind us to what really makes us human in the first place, which is our capacity – as moral and social beings – to negotiate between such alternatives. As we’ve already observed, it makes no sense to ask any such questions of a fish or a hedgehog. Animals already exist in a state ‘beyond good and evil’, the very one that Nietzsche dreamed humans might also aspire to. Perhaps we are doomed always to be arguing about such things.

These new elites will, as Rousseau emphasized, band together to protect their assets, so the advent of private property will be followed, inexorably, by the rise of ‘the state’.

Roughly 6,000 years stand between the appearance of the first farmers in the Middle East and the rise of what we are used to calling the first states; and in many parts of the world, farming never led to the emergence of anything remotely like those states.7

In the nineteenth century, Marx and many of his fellow radicals did imagine that it was possible to administer such a surplus collectively, in an equitable fashion (this is what he envisioned as being the norm under ‘primitive communism’, and what he thought could once again be possible in the revolutionary future), but contemporary thinkers tend to be more sceptical. In fact, the dominant view among anthropologists nowadays is that the only way to maintain a truly egalitarian society is to eliminate the possibility of accumulating any sort of surplus at all.

Few anthropologists are particularly happy with the term ‘egalitarian societies’, for reasons that should now be obvious; but it lingers on because no one has suggested a compelling alternative. The closest we’re aware of is the feminist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock’s suggestion that most members of what are called egalitarian societies seem less interested in equality per se than what she calls ‘autonomy’. What matters to Montagnais-Naskapi women, for instance, is not so much whether men and women are seen to be of equal status but whether women are, individually or collectively, able to live their lives and make their own decisions without male interference.9

what the Hadza, Wendat or ‘egalitarian’ people such as the Nuer seem to have been concerned with were not so much formal freedoms as substantive ones.12 They were less interested in the right to travel than in the possibility of actually doing so (hence, the matter was typically framed as an obligation to provide hospitality to strangers). Mutual aid – what contemporary European observers often referred to as ‘communism’ – was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy.

Even in sexual life, then, for women as for men, individual freedom was assumed unless there was some specific reason to curtail it. — The freedom to abandon one’s community, knowing one will be welcomed in faraway lands; the freedom to shift back and forth between social structures, depending on the time of year; the freedom to disobey authorities without consequence – all appear to have been simply assumed among our distant ancestors, even if most people find them barely conceivable today. Humans may not have begun their history in a state of primordial innocence, but they do appear to have begun it with a self-conscious aversion to being told what to do.15 If this is so, we can at least refine our initial question: the real puzzle is not when chiefs, or even kings and queens, first appeared, but rather when it was no longer possible simply to laugh them out of court.

By framing the stages of human development largely around the ways people went about acquiring food, men like Adam Smith and Turgot inevitably put work – previously considered a somewhat plebeian concern – centre stage. There was a simple reason for this. It allowed them to claim that their own societies were self-evidently superior, a claim that – at the time – would have been much harder to defend had they used any criterion other than productive labour.16

over the course of the nineteenth century, almost everyone arguing about the overall direction of human civilization took it for granted that technological progress was the prime mover of history, and that if progress was the story of human liberation, this could only mean liberation from ‘unnecessary toil’: at some future time, science would eventually free us from at least the most degrading, onerous and soul-destroying forms of work. In fact, by the Victorian era many began arguing that this was already happening. Industrialized farming and new labour-saving devices, they claimed, were already leading us towards a world where everyone would enjoy an existence of leisure and affluence – and where we wouldn’t have to spend most of our waking lives running about at someone else’s orders. Granted, this must have seemed a bizarre claim to radical trade unionists in Chicago who, as late as the 1880s, had to engage in pitched battles with police and company detectives in order to win an eight-hour day – that is, obtain the right to a daily work regime that the average medieval baron would have considered unreasonable to expect of his serfs.17 Yet, perhaps as a riposte to such campaigns, Victorian intellectuals began arguing that exactly the opposite was true: ‘primitive man’, they posited, had been engaged in a constant struggle for his very existence; life in early human societies was a perpetual chore. European or Chinese or Egyptian peasants toiled from dawn till dusk to eke out a living. And so, it followed, even the awful work regimes of the Dickensian age were actually an improvement on what had come before. All we are arguing about, they insisted, is the pace of improvement. By the dawn of the twentieth century, such reasoning had become universally accepted as common sense.

As indigenous legal scholars have been pointing out for years, the ‘Agricultural Argument’ makes no sense, even on its own terms. There are many ways, other than European-style farming, in which to care for and improve the productivity of land. What to a settler’s eye seemed savage, untouched wilderness usually turns out to be landscapes actively managed by indigenous populations for thousands of years through controlled burning, weeding, coppicing, fertilizing and pruning, terracing estuarine plots to extend the habitat of particular wild flora, building clam gardens in intertidal zones to enhance the reproduction of shellfish, creating weirs to catch salmon, bass and sturgeon, and so on. Such procedures were often labour-intensive, and regulated by indigenous laws governing who could access groves, swamps, root beds, grasslands and fishing grounds, and who was entitled to exploit what species at any given time of year. In parts of Australia, these indigenous techniques of land management were such that, according to one recent study, we should stop speaking of ‘foraging’ altogether, and refer instead to a different sort of farming.38

Now, these sacred items are, in many cases, the only important and exclusive forms of property that exist in societies where personal autonomy is taken to be a paramount value, or what we may simply call ‘free societies’. It’s not just relations of command that are strictly confined to sacred contexts, or even occasions when humans impersonate spirits; so too is absolute – or what we would today refer to as ‘private’ – property. In such societies, there turns out to be a profound formal similarity between the notion of private property and the notion of the sacred. Both are, essentially, structures of exclusion.

To recognize the close parallels between private property and notions of the sacred is also to recognize what is so historically odd about European social thought. Which is that – quite unlike free societies – we take this absolute, sacred quality in private property as a paradigm for all human rights and freedoms. This is what the political scientist C. B. Macpherson meant by ‘possessive individualism’. Just as every man’s home is his castle, so your right not to be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned rests on the idea that you own your own body, just as you own your chattels and possessions, and legally have the right to exclude others from your land, or house, or car, and so on.53 As we’ve seen, those who did not share this particular European conception of the sacred could indeed be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned – and, from Amazonia to Oceania, they often were.54

Of course, European colonization had a profound and catastrophic impact on the distribution of Native American peoples, but what we are seeing here also reflects a deeper continuity of culture-historical development, a process that tended to occur at various points in human history, when modern nation states were not around to order populations into neat ethno-linguistic groups. Arguably, the very idea that the world is divided into such homogeneous units, each with its own history, is largely a product of the modern nation state, and the desire of each to claim for itself a deep territorial lineage. At the very least, we should think twice before projecting such uniformities back in time, on to remote periods of human history for which no direct evidence of language distributions even exists.

In terms of labour, flood-retreat farming is not only pretty light, it also requires little central management. Critically, such systems have a kind of inbuilt resistance to the enclosure and measurement of land. Any given parcel of territory might be fertile one year, and then either flooded or dried out the next, so there is little incentive for long-term ownership or enclosure of fixed plots. It makes little sense to set up boundary stones when the ground itself is shifting underneath you. No form of human ecology is ‘innately’ egalitarian, but much as Rousseau and his epigones would have been surprised to hear it, these early cultivation systems did not lend themselves to the development of private property. If anything, flood-retreat farming was practically oriented towards the collective holding of land, or at least flexible systems of field reallocation.41

It will by now be increasingly obvious to any reader that almost nothing about this established narrative matches the available evidence. In the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, long regarded as the cradle of the ‘Agricultural Revolution’, there was in fact no ‘switch’ from Palaeolithic forager to Neolithic farmer. The transition from living mainly on wild resources to a life based on food production took something in the order of 3,000 years. And while agriculture allowed for the possibility of more unequal concentrations of wealth, in most cases this only began to happen millennia after its inception. In the centuries between, people were effectively trying farming on for size, ‘play farming’ if you will, switching between modes of production, much as they switched their social structures back and forth.

use phrases like ‘the Agricultural Revolution’ when dealing with processes of such inordinate length and complexity. And since there was no Eden-like state from which the first farmers could take their first steps on the road to inequality, it makes even less sense to talk about agriculture as marking the origins of social rank, inequality or private property. In the Fertile Crescent, it is – if anything – among upland groups, furthest removed from a dependence on agriculture, that we find stratification and violence becoming entrenched; while their lowland counterparts, who linked the production of crops to important social rituals, come out looking decidedly more egalitarian; and much of this egalitarianism relates to an increase in the economic and social visibility of women, reflected in their art and ritual.

The conventional story looks for the ultimate causes in technological factors: cities were a delayed, but inevitable, effect of the ‘Agricultural Revolution’, which started populations on an upward trajectory and set off a chain of other developments, for instance in transport and administration, which made it possible to support large populations living in one place. These large populations then required states to administer them. As we’ve seen, neither part of this story seems to be borne out by the facts.

It’s important to stress that we are not arguing that the very first cities to appear in any region of the world were invariably founded on egalitarian principles (in fact, we will shortly see a perfect counter-example). What we are saying is that archaeological evidence shows this to have been a surprisingly common pattern, which goes against conventional evolutionary assumptions about the effects of scale on human society. In each of the cases we’ve considered so far – Ukrainian mega-sites, Uruk Mesopotamia, the Indus valley – a dramatic increase in the scale of organized human settlement took place with no resulting concentration of wealth or power in the hands of ruling elites. In short, archaeological research has shifted the burden of proof on to those theorists who claim causal connections between the origins of cities and the rise of stratified states, and whose claims now look increasingly hollow.

We like to tell ourselves that Europeans introduced the Americas not just to these agents of destruction but also to modern industrial democracy, ingredients for which were nowhere to be found there, not even in embryo. All this supposedly came as a single cultural package: advanced metallurgy, animal-powered vehicles, alphabetic writing systems and a certain penchant for freethinking that is seen as necessary for technological progress. ‘Natives’, in contrast, are assumed to have existed in some sort of alternative, quasi-mystical universe. They could not, by definition, be arguing about political constitutions or engaging in processes of sober deliberation over decisions that changed the course of world history; and if European observers report them doing so, they must either be mistaken, or were simply projecting on to ‘Indians’ their own ideas about democratic governance, even when those ideas were hardly practised in Europe itself. As we’ve also seen, this way of reading history would have been quite alien to Enlightenment philosophers, who were more inclined to think their ideals of freedom and equality owed much to the peoples of the New World and were by no means certain if those ideals were at all compatible with industrial advance. We are dealing, again, with powerful modern myths. Such myths don’t merely inform what people say: to an even greater extent, they ensure certain things go unnoticed. Some of the key early sources on Tlaxcala have never even appeared in translation, and new data emerging in recent years has not really been noticed outside specialist circles. Let’s see if we can’t set the record straight.

If we are seeking an ancient precedent to this aspect of modern democracy, we shouldn’t turn to the assemblies of Athens, Syracuse or Corinth, but instead – paradoxically – to aristocratic contests of ‘heroic ages’, such as those described in the Iliad, with its endless agons: races, duels, games, gifts and sacrifices. As we noted in Chapter Nine, the political philosophers of later Greek cities did not actually consider elections a democratic way of selecting candidates for public office at all. The democratic method was sortition, or lottery, much like modern jury duty. Elections were assumed to belong to the aristocratic mode (aristocracy meaning ‘rule of the best’), allowing commoners – much like the retainers in an old-fashioned, heroic aristocracy – to decide who among the well born should be considered best of all; and well born, in this context, simply meant all those who could afford to spend much of their time playing at politics.3

What is true of time, incidentally, is also true of space. For the last 5,000 years of human history – i.e. roughly the span of time we will be moving around in, over the course of this chapter – our conventional vision of world history is a chequerboard of cities, empires and kingdoms; but in fact, for most of this period these were exceptional islands of political hierarchy, surrounded by much larger territories whose inhabitants, if visible at all to historians’ eyes, are variously described as ‘tribal confederacies’, ‘amphictyonies’ or (if you’re an anthropologist) ‘segmentary societies’ – that is, people who systematically avoided fixed, overarching systems of authority. We know a bit about how such societies worked in parts of Africa, North America, Central or Southeast Asia and other regions where such loose and flexible political associations existed into recent times, but we know frustratingly little of how they operated in periods when these were by far the world’s most common forms of government.

For whatever reasons, the answer that gained traction across the Nile valley around 3500 bc was that ancestors do indeed get hungry, and what they required was something which, at that time, can only have been considered a rather exotic and perhaps luxurious form of food: leavened bread and fermented wheat beer, the pot-containers for which now start to become standard fixtures of well-appointed grave assemblages. It is no coincidence that arable wheat-farming – though long familiar in the valley and delta of the Nile – was only refined and intensified around this time, at least partly in response to the new demands of the dead.87 The two processes – agronomic and ceremonial – were mutually reinforcing, and the social effects epochal. In effect, they led to the creation of what might be considered the world’s first peasantry. As in so many parts of the world initially favoured by Neolithic populations, the periodic flooding of the Nile had at first made permanent division of lands difficult; quite likely, it was not ecological circumstances but the social requirement to provide bread and beer on ceremonial occasions that allowed such divisions to become entrenched. This was not just a matter of access to sufficient quantities of arable land, but also the means to maintain ploughs and oxen – another introduction of the late fourth millennium bc. Families who found themselves unable to command such resources had to obtain beer and loaves elsewhere, creating networks of obligation and debt. Hence important class distinctions and dependencies did, in fact, begin to emerge,88 as a sizeable sector of Egypt’s population found itself deprived of the means to care independently for ancestors.

So do these ‘early states’ have any common features at all? Obviously, some basic generalizations can be made. All deployed spectacular violence at the pinnacle of the system; all ultimately depended on and to some degree mimicked the patriarchal organization of households. In every case, the apparatus of government stood on top of some kind of division of society into classes. But as we’ve seen in earlier chapters, these elements could just as well exist without or prior to the creation of central government – and even when such government was established, they could take very different forms.

To understand the realities of power, whether in modern or ancient societies, is to acknowledge this gap between what elites claim they can do and what they are actually able to do. As the sociologist Philip Abrams pointed out long ago, failure to make this distinction has led social scientists up countless blind alleys, because the state is ‘not the reality which stands behind the mask of political practice. It is itself the mask which prevents our seeing political practice as it is.’ To understand the latter, he argued, we must attend to ‘the senses in which the state does not exist rather than to those in which it does’.138 We can now see that these points apply just as forcefully to ancient political regimes as they do to modern ones – if not more so.

But, what is a feminist reading of debt? Here we start with a brief practical guide. 1. A feminist reading of debt proposes concrete bodies and narratives of its operation in opposition to financial abstraction. Finance boasts of being abstract, of belonging to the sky of mysterious quotes, of functioning according to logics that cannot be comprehended by common people. It tries to present itself as a true black box, in which decisions are made in a mathematical, algorithmic way about what has value and what does not. By narrating how it functions in households, popular (largely non-waged), and waged economies, we defy its power of abstraction, its attempt to be unfathomable. That becomes clear in the interviews included in this book. Debt is a concrete mechanism that forces small agricultural producers to become dependent on agrotoxins. Debt is an expression of the rising costs and financialization of basic services. Debt is an apparatus that connects the inside and outside of prison, while prison itself is shown to be a system of debt. Debt is what you incur when abortion is criminalized. Debt is what drives popular consumption when exorbitant interest rates cause domestic life, health, and community bonds to explode. Debt is what enables illegal economies to recruit workers at any price. Debt incurred by young people, even “before” entering the labor market or in hyper-precarious jobs (since they are given a credit card along with their state benefits and first paycheck) appears as an apparatus of capture and precaritization of those very incomes. Debt is what provides basic infrastructure for life: health services that are inaccessible, supplies for when a child is born, purchasing a motorcycle to be able to work in food delivery. Debt is a way of guaranteeing access to housing. Debt is the resource that appears when one is faced with emergencies and confronted by the loss of other support networks. Debt is a mechanism of generalized dispossession of migrant and Black populations. Debt is what ties together dependence on violent family relations.

It is a powerful scene of torture: they literally write the terror that they want to communicate on women’s bodies. The assailants write on the body of the teacher in struggle, torturing her. It transmits a message: the same one that was already circulating through anonymous fliers that said that the next olla would be in the cemetery.

Debt, if we understand it historically as a response to a specific sequence of struggles, is also a mechanism for the extraction of life time and labor time, reconfiguring the very notion of class. Our hypothesis is that debt functions retroactively as a machine of capture of social inventions aimed at the self-management of work and the politicization of social reproduction.

Social protests provide us with the interpretative coordinates for understanding how debt has organized its expansion as an apparatus of class government. However, this also requires thinking about what we classify as conflicts, capable of challenging the valorization of capital. We see the repetition of a philosophical and nostalgic mansplaining that only recognizes revolution (of course, defeated) in the 1970s (see, for example, Lazzarato 2020). The feminist reading of debt is precisely the opposite: it recognizes the massiveness and radicality of the feminist revolution that we are witnessing today.

While employment is intermittent, debt is long term. Thus, it functions as continuity in terms of its obligation in the face of the discontinuity of income, making those incomes (that are increasingly used to make interest and installment payments) even more fragile, and as a growing blackmail forcing people to accept any type of working conditions.

When the union recognizes the production of value in reproductive, communitarian, neighborhood, and precarious tasks, the union limit ceases to be a “fence” that confines work as exclusively belonging to formal workers. This gesture also shines light on other tasks that are covered up and that the wage and precarization also exploit.

careful review of oral traditions, historical accounts and the ethnographic record shows that those who framed what we call the ‘indigenous critique’ of European civilization were not only keenly aware of alternative political possibilities, but for the most part saw their own social orders as self-conscious creations, designed as a barrier against all that Cahokia might have represented – or indeed, all those qualities they were later to find so objectionable in the French.

It is important to remember Puerto Rico’s political status: it is an unincorporated territory of the United States, which means that Puerto Rico belongs to the United States, but is not part of it. A year before the hurricane, in 2016, a “Fiscal Control Board” dedicated to restructuring the territory’s debt landed on the island: a new form of colonial government that, on the one hand, exempts the United States from taking responsibility for its annexed territories and, on the other, ensures that the debt is paid. In other words, debt restructuring is the only option and, to do so, an elite is directly established to design the restructuring and supervise the local government.

But debating debt does not only mean talking about debt. Debt is directly connected with budget cuts to public services, wage decreases, with the recognition of domestic work, and with the need to go into debt to get an abortion. We only go into debt because we have already been left without other resources. Debt only comes to “save us” because we have been violently impoverished, to the point of an induced precarity. Debt becomes unpayable because first there was looting and dispossession.

Speaking of debt from a feminist perspective allows us to clearly see what is feeding the global flows of financial capital, which seek to appropriate pensions, wages, and an enormous quantity of free and precarious labor that is what moves the world today, that drives extractivist dispossession and enables the extraordinary profitability of multinational corporations. We have identified and denounced this operation due to its direct connection with the increase in labor, institutional, racist, and sexist forms of violence.

The more rosy, optimistic narrative – whereby the progress of Western civilization inevitably makes everyone happier, wealthier and more secure – has at least one obvious disadvantage. It fails to explain why that civilization did not simply spread of its own accord; that is, why European powers should have been obliged to spend the last 500 or so years aiming guns at people’s heads in order to force them to adopt it. (Also, if being in a ‘savage’ state was so inherently miserable, why so many of those same Westerners, given an informed choice, were so eager to defect to it at the earliest opportunity.)

The Enlightenment is seen as introducing a possibility that had simply not existed before: that of self-conscious projects for reshaping society in accord with some rational ideal. That is, of genuine revolutionary politics. Obviously, insurrections and visionary movements had existed before the eighteenth century. No one could deny that. But such pre-Enlightenment social movements could now largely be dismissed as so many examples of people insisting on a return to certain ‘ancient ways’ (that they had often just made up), or else claiming to act on a vision from God (or the local equivalent).

Pre-Enlightenment societies, or so this argument goes, were ‘traditional’ societies, founded on community, status, authority and the sacred. They were societies in which human beings did not ultimately act for themselves, individually or collectively. Rather, they were slaves of custom; or, at best, agents of inexorable social forces which they projected on to the cosmos in the form of gods, ancestors or other supernatural powers. Supposedly, only modern, post-Enlightenment people had the capacity to self-consciously intervene in history and change its course; on this everyone suddenly seemed to agree, no matter how virulently they might disagree about whether it was a good idea to do so.

Since historical events are by definition unpredictable, it seemed more scientific to study those phenomena one could in fact predict: the things that kept happening, over and over, in roughly the same way. In a Senegalese or Burmese village this might mean describing the daily round, seasonal cycles, rites of passage, patterns of dynastic succession, or the growing and splitting of villages, always emphasizing how the same structure ultimately endured. Anthropologists wrote this way because they considered themselves scientists (‘structural-functionalists’, in the jargon of the day). In doing so they made it much easier for those reading their descriptions to imagine that the people being studied were quite the opposite of scientists: that they were trapped in a mythological universe where nothing changed and very little really happened. When Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, proposed that ‘traditional’ societies lived in ‘cyclical time’, innocent of history, he was simply drawing the obvious conclusion. As a matter of fact, he went even further.

When Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, proposed that ‘traditional’ societies lived in ‘cyclical time’, innocent of history, he was simply drawing the obvious conclusion. As a matter of fact, he went even further. In traditional societies, according to Eliade, everything important has already happened. All the great founding gestures go back to mythic times, the illo tempore,1 the dawn of everything, when animals could talk or turn into humans, sky and earth were not yet separated, and it was possible to create genuinely new things (marriage, or cooking, or war). People living in this mental world, he felt, saw their own actions as simply repeating the creative gestures of gods and ancestors in less powerful ways, or as invoking primordial powers through ritual. According to Eliade, historical events thus tended to merge into archetypes. If anyone in what he considered a traditional society does do something remarkable – establishes or destroys a city, creates a unique piece of music – the deed will eventually end up being attributed to some mythic figure anyway. The alternative notion, that history is actually going somewhere (the Last Days, Judgment, Redemption), is what Eliade referred to as ‘linear time’, in which historical events take on significance in relation to the future, not just the past. And this ‘linear’ sense of time, Eliade insisted, was a relatively recent innovation in human thought, one with catastrophic social and psychological consequences. In his view, embracing the notion that events unfold in cumulative sequences, as opposed to recapitulating some deeper pattern, rendered us less able to weather the vicissitudes of war, injustice and misfortune, plunging us instead into an age of unprecedented anxiety and, ultimately, nihilism. The political implications of this position were, to say the least, unsettling. Eliade himself had been close to the fascist Iron Guard in his student days, and his basic argument was that the ‘terror of history’ (as he sometimes called it) was introduced by Judaism and the Old Testament – which he saw as paving the way for the further disasters of Enlightenment thought. Being Jewish, the authors of the present book don’t particularly appreciate the suggestion that we are somehow to blame for everything that went wrong in history. Still, for present purposes, what’s startling is that anyone ever took this sort of argument seriously.

Social science has been largely a study of the ways in which human beings are not free: the way that our actions and understandings might be said to be determined by forces outside our control. Any account which appears to show human beings collectively shaping their own destiny, or even expressing freedom for its own sake, will likely be written off as illusory, awaiting ‘real’ scientific explanation; or if none is forthcoming (why do people dance?), as outside the scope of social theory entirely. This is one reason why most ‘big histories’ place such a strong focus on technology. Dividing up the human past according to the primary material from which tools and weapons were made (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age) or else describing it as a series of revolutionary breakthroughs (Agricultural Revolution, Urban Revolution, Industrial Revolution), they then assume that the technologies themselves largely determine the shape that human societies will take for centuries to come – or at least until the next abrupt and unexpected breakthrough comes along to change everything again.

Choosing to describe history the other way round, as a series of abrupt technological revolutions, each followed by long periods when we were prisoners of our own creations, has consequences. Ultimately it is a way of representing our species as decidedly less thoughtful, less creative, less free than we actually turn out to have been. It means not describing history as a continual series of new ideas and innovations, technical or otherwise, during which different communities made collective decisions about which technologies they saw fit to apply to everyday purposes, and which to keep confined to the domain of experimentation or ritual play. What is true of technological creativity is, of course, even more true of social creativity. One of the most striking patterns we discovered while researching this book – indeed, one of the patterns that felt most like a genuine breakthrough to us – was how, time and again in human history, that zone of ritual play has also acted as a site of social experimentation – even, in some ways, as an encyclopaedia of social possibilities.

To say that, for most of human history, the ritual year served as a kind of compendium of social possibilities (as it did in the European Middle Ages, for instance, when hierarchical pageants alternated with rambunctious carnivals), doesn’t really do the matter justice. This is because festivals are already seen as extraordinary, somewhat unreal, or at the very least as departures from the everyday order. Whereas, in fact, the evidence we have from Palaeolithic times onwards suggests that many – perhaps even most – people did not merely imagine or enact different social orders at different times of year, but actually lived in them for extended periods of time. The contrast with our present situation could not be more stark. Nowadays, most of us find it increasingly difficult even to picture what an alternative economic or social order would be like. Our distant ancestors seem, by contrast, to have moved regularly back and forth between them.

Over the course of these chapters we have instead talked about basic forms of social liberty which one might actually put into practice: (1) the freedom to move away or relocate from one’s surroundings; (2) the freedom to ignore or disobey commands issued by others; and (3) the freedom to shape entirely new social realities, or shift back and forth between different ones.

‘There is no way out of the imagined order,’ writes Yuval Noah Harari in his book Sapiens. ‘When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom’, he goes on, ‘we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison.’5 As we saw in our first chapter, he is not alone in reaching this conclusion. Most people who write history on a grand scale seem to have decided that, as a species, we are well and truly stuck and there is really no escape from the institutional cages we’ve made for ourselves. Harari, once again echoing Rousseau, seems to have captured the prevailing mood.

The state, as we know it today, results from a distinct combination of elements – sovereignty, bureaucracy and a competitive political field – which have entirely separate origins. In our thought experiment of two chapters ago, we showed how those elements map directly on to basic forms of social power which can operate at any scale of human interaction, from the family or household all the way up to the Roman Empire or the super-kingdom of Tawantinsuyu. Sovereignty, bureaucracy and politics are magnifications of elementary types of domination, grounded respectively in the use of violence, knowledge and charisma

in the course of this book, we sometimes felt the need to develop our own, more neutral (dare we say scientific?) list of baseline human freedoms and forms of domination; because existing debates almost invariably begin with terms derived from Roman Law, and for a number of reasons this is problematic. The Roman Law conception of natural freedom is essentially based on the power of the individual (by implication, a male head of household) to dispose of his property as he sees fit. In Roman Law property isn’t even exactly a right, since rights are negotiated with others and involve mutual obligations; it’s simply power – the blunt reality that someone in possession of a thing can do anything he wants with it, except that which is limited ‘by force or law’. This formulation has some peculiarities that jurists have struggled with ever since, as it implies freedom is essentially a state of primordial exception to the legal order. It also implies that property is not a set of understandings between people over who gets to use or look after things, but rather a relation between a person and an object characterized by absolute power. What does it mean to say one has the natural right to do anything one wants with a hand grenade, say, except those things one isn’t allowed to do? Who would come up with such an odd formulation? An answer is suggested by the West Indian sociologist Orlando Patterson, who points out that Roman Law conceptions of property (and hence of freedom) essentially trace back to slave law.9 The reason it is possible to imagine property as a relationship of domination between a person and a thing is because, in Roman Law, the power of the master rendered the slave a thing (res, meaning an object), not a person with social rights or legal obligations to anyone else. Property law, in turn, was largely about the complicated situations that might arise as a result. It is important to recall, for a moment, who these Roman jurists actually were that laid down the basis for our current legal order – our theories of justice, the language of contract and torts, the distinction of public and private and so forth. While they spent their public lives making sober judgments as magistrates, they lived their private lives in households where they not only had near-total authority over their wives, children and other dependants, but also had all their needs taken care of by dozens, perhaps hundreds of slaves.

Our very word ‘family’ shares a root with the Latin famulus, meaning ‘house slave’, via familia, which originally referred to everyone under the domestic authority of a single paterfamilias or male head of household. Domus, the Latin word for ‘household’, in turn gives us not only ‘domestic’ and ‘domesticated’ but dominium, which was the technical term for the emperor’s sovereignty as well as a citizen’s power over private property. Through that we arrive at (literally, ‘familiar’) notions of what it means to be ‘dominant’, to possess ‘dominion’ and to ‘dominate’.

Public torture, in seventeenth-century Europe, created searing, unforgettable spectacles of pain and suffering in order to convey the message that a system in which husbands could brutalize wives, and parents beat children, was ultimately a form of love. Wendat torture, in the same period of history, created searing, unforgettable spectacles of pain and suffering in order to make clear that no form of physical chastisement should ever be countenanced inside a community or household. Violence and care, in the Wendat case, were to be entirely separated.

Of course, monarchy, warrior aristocracies or other forms of stratification could also take hold in urban contexts, and often did. When this happened the consequences were dramatic. Still, the mere existence of large human settlements in no way caused these phenomena, and certainly didn’t make them inevitable. For the origins of these structures of domination we must look elsewhere. Hereditary aristocracies were just as likely to exist among demographically small or modest-sized groups, such as the ‘heroic societies’ of the Anatolian highlands, which took form on the margins of the first Mesopotamian cities and traded extensively with them. Insofar as we have evidence for the inception of monarchy as a permanent institution it seems to lie precisely there, and not in cities. In other parts of the world, some urban populations ventured partway down the road towards monarchy, only to turn back. Such was the case at Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, where the city’s population – having raised the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon – then abandoned such aggrandizing projects and embarked instead on a prodigious programme of social housing, providing multi-family apartments for its residents.

Released from the old ties of feudalism, the worker is ‘free’ to enter into a contract with an employer. Workers can sell the use of their particular skills and capacities to any buyer. This is a dubious freedom because it takes place against a background of coercion – if you don’t ‘freely’ contract, you won’t be able to survive. In the contemporary UK, the welfare benefits system won, at least in part, by workers in the twentieth century, means that you, provided you can navigate the system and are eligible for benefits (itself not a given), can (try to) survive without a job. Restrictions, conditionality and cuts introduced to the benefits system, however, mean there is intense pressure on claimants to return to waged work. The balance of power within this contract can be skewed towards employers, too. Workers could be imprisoned for leaving contracts of employment early, without the permission of their employer, until the mid-1870s.17

The garment industry shows us how the conditions of work change – from within a household to outside of it. It’s not that pre-industrial life was idyllic, peaceful, or non-exploitative. That most people no longer know how to make fabric or sew clothes is not something bad, except perhaps insofar as it makes people more reliant on the market. New technologies and labour-saving processes can be good things: the problem is who owns the technology required for these processes and in whose interest that technology is developed and run. At the moment, the infrastructure of production is geared towards maximising profit. The terms on which workers are hired and what they do in their role is decided by management. In unionised industries, trade unions can negotiate what these terms are, but rarely do workers get to decide for themselves what they do.

technology can be expensive to buy and to maintain. Consider the decline of the mechanical car washes that used to be found on most petrol station forecourts in the 1990s. These machines, first developed in the 1970s, have had their position on petrol station forecourts usurped. They have been replaced not by the dazzling new robotic technologies of Boston Dynamics, but by manual car-washing.23 Machines are expensive to buy and maintain, and in the place of mechanical car washes have sprung up thousands of small, hand car wash firms, many of which are unlicensed and with plenty of evidence of extreme exploitation of migrant workers. They often straddle the formal and informal sectors. Car washes are one of the most commonly reported sites of labour exploitation according to the Modern Slavery Helpline run by the NGO Unseen.24 How we work is shaped not by technology alone, but by existing relations of power. When labour does not have much power, particularly in the context of low wages, there is little pressure to automate jobs.

Despite the centrality of ‘free’ contract-bound work to capitalism, there are more people in slavery today than at any other point in history. And the majority of the world’s population (60%) work in the informal or shadow sector, outside of contract-bound employment.26

Work is, in the eyes of the law, a specific legally bounded entity with rights and responsibilities – on the part of the employer and the employee or worker.11 These are not contracts made between equals but by two parties with extremely different amounts and types of power. However, they do offer protection to workers, including the right to a written statement of employment particulars, an itemised payslip, the minimum wage, to maternity leave, to reasonable time off and to sick pay. While these rights are fragile and are sometimes ignored by employers even if they’d be held up at tribunal, they are much better than having no possibility of legal recourse.

As such, many current labour campaigns are focused on fighting for the legal recognition of certain activities as work. Foremost among these is organising by sex workers which seeks to secure safety, including through their legal rights as workers by the decriminalisation of sex work.

The term Fordist is used as a metonym for a particular time in history as well as a particular kind of mass factory work, dominated by the production line. The term gained popularity after its early use by the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci in the 1930s, but is most typically applied to the decades of prosperity with mass, standardised production between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s. It’s typically bookended on one side by Taylorism – the project of scientific workplace management that measured a worker’s movements. Taylorism excited Lenin, America’s factory-owners and wealthy, suburban housewives alike. On its other side is Toyotism, lean or ‘just-in-time’ production, that seeks to eliminate waste (of time, of resources, of inventory) on the line and throughout the production process. None of these historical moments should be viewed as total systems but rather as dominant moods or tendencies.

This pattern of moving between temporary positions is replacing securer Fordist jobs for many workers. Most of the new jobs created tend to be low-paid service work: between 2010 and 2013, for example, four out of five of the jobs created were low-paid.12 The service sector makes up nearly 80% of the UK’s economy.13 Now, Covid-19 puts these jobs, which tend to be in retail and hospitality, at further risk. This means an increasingly polarised workforce, with a small number of people holding secure work, some of which is subjectively fulfilling, too, while the rest of the workforce provides services to those workers.

The neoliberal policies that heralded the end of Fordism didn’t just promise the end of boring work; they promised the end of bureaucracy and the introduction of fast-moving, all-night-long, friction-free capitalism. There is, then, an irony about what happened next. Rather than doing away with restrictions, a growing and deepening layer of bureaucracy emerged within previously public institutions. Two-thirds of UK universities now hire more administrative staff than they do academics. In the US, between 1975 and 2008, the number of faculty grew about 10% while the number of administrators grew 221%.15

This effort is just as much a matter of cajoling existing employees into accepting new, leaner work processes, accepting their fate as neoliberal subjects, as it is about the creation of new standards of comparison. To introduce a market into something that was previously a publicly owned monopoly requires the creation of new processes for capturing, storing, comparing and acting on data.

To introduce a market into something that was previously a publicly owned monopoly requires the creation of new processes for capturing, storing, comparing and acting on data. Moreover, the capture of data in the first place changes the kind of work that even those not directly hired to work with that data do. Consider teaching. How do you record data on something so inherently relational and reciprocal? The first step is to change the tasks involved in a given job so that they can actually be recorded.

The selling-off of key industries and public services remains unpopular with the general public, the majority of whom support public ownership for rail, mail, buses and energy.

Concessions are supposed to do away with the inefficiencies of franchises by stipulating specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and fining concession-runners when these are not met. These KPIs – intended to steer and manage workers – create perverse incentives. One KPI stipulates that there must always be a train-time sign working on every station. If even one side is broken, the concession-runner will be fined. This means that a worker must stand beneath the train time board and provide information on train times to passengers to mitigate the fine, even if the other side of the board is working fine, or another board is clearly visible. The train is run to the performance indicators, maximising profit, even if it negatively impacts the service in some other way. This is strikingly clear in an issue one RMT rep raised with me: if they have a late train, they must frequently cancel stops at smaller stations to make up time and avoid the fine, even if that means leaving five or ten passengers sitting on a platform for half an hour extra.

However, it is possible to say that the emotional demands placed on workers, alongside the precarity and lack of control over their time at work, and their time in general, further problematise the idea of continuously improving working lives. In fact, as the concession shows, the arcane and ritualised customer service practices that shape a great deal of contemporary work leave people detached from the tasks their jobs involve or should involve, and from their own selves.

In some cases, this punitive system has led directly to their deaths, with Calum’s List documenting the suicides that have occurred as a result of welfare reform,24 and the Disability News Service presenting the ‘Case for the Prosecution’ of the Department for Work and Pensions following five years of research into the deaths of people found ‘fit to work’ and the alleged misconduct in public office of senior civil servants and ministers in the Department.

In fact, the term ‘social media’ or ‘social network’ is misleading; these are companies that form, as the writer Richard Seymour puts it, ‘a social industry’. This industry, he argues, is ‘able, through the production and harvesting of data, to objectify and quantify social life in numerical form.’ While we are enjoying ourselves online, we are giving platforms all kinds of information about ourselves. It’s not just an issue of privacy. It’s that our social tendencies, our capacities for care and interest in others, our concern for how we might come across to others are rendered intelligible to and profitable for companies. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to use social media platforms but we are encouraged to use them, to feel connected to others, to get the dopamine rush of a new notification, but all the time our capacities, desires, and actions are put to work. We might think we’re interacting with our friends or other platform users but, as Seymour reminds us, we’re really interacting with the platforms, ‘with the machine. We write to it, and it passes on the message for us, after keeping a record of the data.’14 While our leisure lives were once separate, at least spatially and temporally, from our working day, they form, in growing proportion, the raw material for social media platform profits.

So far, we have mainly talked in terms of two classes – those who sell hours of their lives, and those who buy that time and profit from it. It’s important not to lose sight of this distinction. I have been keen to stress it because this fundamental fact, one that governs our lives and defines our economic system, is so often ignored. However, within this first group – those who must work to live – there is a huge range of experience, gradations that can appear so significant as to call into question the unity of the first group.

In response to the male control of unions, some feminists argued that women should not join trade unions – that they were irreparably bad.15 While the legacy of sexist protectionism, particularly over ‘skill’ might make these attitudes understandable, this is completely the wrong approach; unions are institutions that need to be struggled within as well as through. Unions are representative bodies of the working class, but they are not representative mechanically, automatically, but rather through political struggle and political contestation.

The second experiment in worker control is one that didn’t even get a chance to be put down or betrayed because it was not permitted to come into existence. This was the Lucas Plan: a concrete dream of reimagined production, preserving jobs and producing socially useful products. It was a response to the threat of a firm’s closure – in this case, Lucas Industries, a UK company involved in military production – and to management’s predictable response to economic crisis – as the slogan goes: cuts, job losses, money for the bosses. The plan was drawn up between 1975 and 1976, drawing on and developing the tacit knowledge of the production process that workers possess. A questionnaire was sent to all union members, asking them what they thought they should be making. Through this, 150 ideas for products made using existing machinery and with workers’ existing skill sets were dreamt up. These included kidney machines and portable life support machines, along with other medical devices; alternative energy sources such as technology for solar and wind power, along with the more outlandish, like a road-rail vehicle, able to avail itself of the road and the railway network.24

It was nominated for a Nobel peace prize in 1979.25 Management, however, didn’t take it seriously. It didn’t help that one of its early supporters, the then Secretary of State for Industry, Tony Benn, was no longer in post. Without support from Westminster and with management hellbent on their plans for closure, the trade unionists found themselves isolated, and their democratic and green vision shelved. This kind of transformative vision, making use of the tacit knowledge of workers, offers the possibility of reorienting production away from arms and environmental degradation and towards socially valuable, life-sustaining productive activity.

Betty Friedan, liberal feminist of the American second wave, urged women to hire housekeepers to deal with the problem of time, to allow them to participate more fully in work, and to find themselves and meaning in so doing.6 Gaining control over one’s own time means, in a society like ours, that the work that we would do is dislodged rather than removed or transformed; it falls onto someone, typically another woman, with less social power, with less ability to refuse.

Denaturalising makes visible that something is a historically contingent set of power-relations, rather than a ‘natural’, unchanging permanent state of affairs. Because capitalism, and, by extension, capitalist work, shapes our desires and our preferences so profoundly, a consciousness against capitalist work, a class consciousness, is something that needs to be developed, rather than something that appears automatically. Translating widespread frustration with individual jobs or individual bosses into frustration with the entire system of bosses and work requires this kind of consciousness.

In fact, no proletariat exists under the neoliberal regime at all. There is no working class being exploited by those who own the means of production. When production is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of production him- or herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper sense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is what accounts for the system’s stability.

Today, the distinction between proletariat and bourgeoisie no longer holds either. Literally, ‘proletarian’ means someone whose sole possessions are his or her children: self-production is restricted to biological reproduction. But now the illusion prevails that every person – as a project free to fashion him- or herself at will – is capable of unlimited self-production. This means that a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is structurally impossible. Today, the Dictatorship of Capital rules over everyone.

People who fail in the neoliberal achievement-society see themselves as responsible for their lot and feel shame instead of questioning society or the system. Herein lies the particular intelligence defining the neoliberal regime: no resistance to the system can emerge in the first place. In contrast, when allo-exploitation prevails, the exploited are still able to show solidarity and unite against those who exploit them. Such is the logic on which Marx’s idea of a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is based. However, this vision presupposes that relations of repression and domination hold. Now, under the neoliberal regime of auto-exploitation, people are turning their aggression against themselves. This auto-aggressivity means that the exploited are not inclined to revolution so much as depression.

The transparency demanded of politicians today is anything but a political demand. Transparency is not called for in political decision-making processes; no consumer is interested in that. Instead, and above all, the imperative of transparency serves to expose or unmask politicians, to make them an item of scandal. The call for transparency presupposes occupying the position of a shocked spectator. It is not voiced by engaged citizens so much as by passive onlookers. Participation now amounts to grievance and complaint. With that, the society of transparency, inhabited by onlookers and consumers, has given rise to a spectator democracy.

Every dispositive – every technology or technique of domination – brings forth characteristic devotional objects that are employed in order to subjugate. Such objects materialize and stabilize dominion. Devotion and related words mean ‘submission’, or ‘obedience’. Smartphones represent digital devotion – indeed, they are the devotional objects of the Digital, period. As a subjectivation-apparatus, the smartphone works like a rosary – which, because of its ready availability, represents a handheld device too. Both the smartphone and the rosary serve the purpose of self-monitoring and control. Power operates more effectively when it delegates surveillance to discrete individuals. Like is the digital Amen. When we click Like, we are bowing down to the order of domination. The smartphone is not just an effective surveillance apparatus; it is also a mobile confessional. Facebook is the church – the global synagogue (literally, ‘assembly’) of the Digital.

Wherever power does not come into view at all, it exists without question. The greater power is, the more quietly it works. It just happens: it has no need to draw attention to itself. To be sure, power can express itself as violence or repression. But it is not based on force. Power need not exclude, prohibit or censor. Not does it stand opposed to freedom. Indeed, power can even use freedom to its own ends. Only in its negative form does power manifest itself as a violence that says ‘no’ by shattering the will and annulling freedom. Today, power is assuming increasingly permissive forms. In its permissivity – indeed, in its friendliness – power is shedding its negativity and presenting itself as freedom.

A significantly more efficient technology of power makes sure that people subordinate themselves to power relations on their own. Such a dynamic seeks to activate, motivate and optimize – not to inhibit or repress. It proves so effective because it does not operate by means of forbidding and depriving, but by pleasing and fulfilling. Instead of making people compliant, it seeks to make them dependent.

The neoliberal technology of power does not prohibit, protect or repress; instead, it prospects, permits and projects. Consumption is not held in check, but maximized. No production of scarcity occurs; instead, surplus is generated – indeed, a superabundance of positivity. Everyone is encouraged to communicate and consume. The principle of negativity, which still defined Orwell’s state, has yielded to the principle of positivity. Needs are not repressed, but stimulated. Confession obtained by force has been replaced by voluntary disclosure. Smartphones have been substituted for torture chambers. Big Brother now wears a friendly face. His friendliness is what makes surveillance so efficient.

When the data collected is published and exchanged, self-tracking comes to resemble self-surveillance more and more. The subject of today’s world is an entrepreneur of the self practising self-exploitation – and, by the same token, self-surveillance. The auto-exploiting subject carries around its own labour camp; here, it is perpetrator and victim at one and the same time. As a self-illuminating, self-surveilling subject, it bears its own, internal panopticon within; here, there is no difference between guard and inmate. The digitalized, networked subject is a panopticon of itself. This ensures that each and every person has now taken on the task of conducting perpetual auto-surveillance.

These interpretations are useful in understanding the mindset of voters, but they beg the crucial question of how the economic interests of the dominant classes came into play in these campaigns. They also contribute to an overly idealistic understanding of electoral processes – suggesting that the vote is essentially a matter of ideas and dominant opinions. They perceive an election as a vast debate that takes place in a democratic arena spanning television networks, newspapers, social media and exchanges between citizens wherever they may be. Following this debate, voters, informed by discussion of the campaign arguments, cast ballots to choose the political vision or programme that has gained their support. The main threat to such a democratic debate lies in the corruption of this democratic arena through argumentative demagogy and other electoral manipulations. As with the elections of Trump and Bolsonaro, many researchers have tried to explain the outcome of the Brexit referendum by highlighting the effects of the fake news that proliferated during the campaign. Writing in the New York Times, political economist Will Davies denounced the way fake news considerably affected the fair expression of ideas during the American presidential campaign.4 And indeed, the Leave vote and the Trump victory led to inquiries into the role of the British company Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of distorting the campaigns by using the personal social media data of British and American citizens to influence the votes. By reducing these political events to the result of electoral manipulations, however, these interpretations miss structural factors. They leave out the power relationships among social groups, including the business community, that have emerged in a spectacular way since 2016 and that have contributed to the change in political regime under way in Europe and the rest of the world.

When reading this chronicle, we see the limits of a political analysis that perceives the state as no more than an instrument of the dominant class. Inspired by agonistic views of society, in these approaches the action of governments is by definition taken to foster the interests of the dominant class. The state does not aim to subsume private interests to the general interest; on the contrary, it aims to augment the advantages that the most powerful enjoy in order to maximise their well-being. The state is then described as lacking the autonomy to pursue its own objectives. The relations of the state with the dominant segments of society can only be relations of subordination. The similar social background and careers of the power elite in place in public administration and in the private sector are advanced as evidence of this subordination.4 Subordination is maintained by the effectiveness of lobbies funded by the dominant classes,5 and by the structural power possessed by dominant groups.6 In this view, the law always benefits the powerful, who do not even need to produce any proof of their might. These analyses generally rest on the conception of the state as the ‘guardian of the interests of the economic elite’, whose real mission is ‘to ensure the perpetuation of its domination’.7 Being merely an instrument in the hands of the powerful, the subjugation of the state knows no bounds. These analyses omit another set of constraints that weigh on the action of the state; namely, the management of populations. The manipulation of the state by the dominant classes is limited by their dependency on other social groups. For instance, it is limited by the need of dominant classes to ensure that state institutions are not overthrown by social unrest. State authorities have to please what, in the 1920s, Antonio Gramsci named ‘civil society’, in order to ensure that subordinated social groups do not use their power of disturbance against the elite. State action in any given period of history depends on how it resolves the conflict between these two orders of dependency: dependency on the dominant classes, whose power is institutionalised by the state, and dependency on civil society, from which the state draws its legitimacy. The state is the institutional representation of the relationship between dominant and dominated groups;8 it acts in a context of double dependency on the dominant classes and on the population that it governs.

Over half (almost 57 per cent) of the money donated to the Leave campaign came from the financial sector, while that sector contributed only 36 per cent of the money donated to the Remain side. This distribution is a first surprise. The campaign most funded by the financial sector was not the one that people commonly think. This table overturns the assumption that the financial sector supported remaining in the European Union, while domestic industrial interests supported leaving. The funding figures show exactly the opposite.

First-wave financial entities dedicated 81.2 per cent of their financial effort to keeping the UK within the EU, while second-wave entities channelled 79.2 per cent of their donations to the pro-Brexit side. These two distinct modes of capital appropriation, investment and accumulation thus appear to be strongly tied to distinct political objectives: the way in which financial actors accumulate money determines their support for the UK remaining in the EU or their preference for Brexit.

Critical researchers have often emphasised that European regulation has resulted in the constitutionalisation of neoliberalism, a programme to confiscate the sovereignty of the people in the interest of capital, which as such has been a very good institutional deal for European capital markets.19 It seems, however, that in the eyes of second-wave financial players Europe has not been accommodating enough.

With the support of emerging international firms in the City, the Thatcher government imposed so-called deregulation measures on the London Stock Exchange, triggering what became known as the 1986 ‘big bang’. The corporatist rules that had limited access to the stock exchange were abolished, and overnight international banks and brokers were allowed to handle trades there. The Securities and Investment Board (SIB) was made responsible for regulating trades, replacing regulation by the Treasury and industry ministerial departments. The board was composed of both civil servants and members from the financial sector. This big bang was part of a wider deregulation movement. Between 1979 and 1989, the successive Thatcher governments had Parliament enact ten laws related to financial deregulation. These laws removed the regulations that limited issuance of credit by banks (June 1980), and then eliminated the liquidity ratios imposed on banks up to this point (August 1981). Consumer loans were deregulated (July 1982), and issuance of housing mortgages was spurred by allowing non-mutual corporations and especially stock listed companies to grant housing loans (1986).

Assuming the role of spokesperson for the newly dominant factions of its financial sector, the British government took the lead in EEC economic policy. This was especially clear starting with the first Delors Commission. Jacques Delors was the candidate favoured by Margaret Thatcher for president of the European Commission. He came with all the guarantees of a good neoliberal temperament that first-wave finance was looking for. Surrounded by technocrats, he had deregulated the French banking and financial sector a few years earlier, and had formed a European Commission dominated by free-marketeers. The Single European Act of 1986 was elaborated under the supervision of the British commissioner to the Common Market chosen by Thatcher herself, Arthur Cockfield, who had already been in charge of abolishing controls on capital and negotiating the financial big bang with the London Stock Exchange in his own country. From 1985 to 1995, the successive Delors commissions demolished the last interventionist institutions remaining from the postwar period and left the field free for the emerging financial entities.

With the European Union now the keystone of a political regime of accumulation favourable to London’s first-wave finance, this could have been the end of the story. But in the late 1990s, first-wave finance began to run out of steam. Financial operators had recovered from what David Harvey called the ‘capitalist crisis of accumulation’ of the 1970s.10 But although financiers had thrived and accumulated capital for two decades, the pace of their accumulation was slowing. At the same time, new financial sectors were emerging in the United States, sectors that operated outside of conventional stock markets and were starting to threaten the position of London-based first-wave finance. Offshore financial centres were beginning to compete with London financial entities and divert a significant share of capital from their business.

But this impressive growth suddenly came to a halt in 2008. Second-wave financial activities had enjoyed the safety of anonymity until then, but the financial crisis put them in the crosshairs of political and media attention. European policymakers on the continent pounced on the idea that the solution to the crisis was ‘to curb the City and the deregulated Anglo-American finance’.15 Beyond responsibility for the financial crisis that was attributed to the exuberant development of second-wave finance, the desire to reign in these activities also resulted from power relationships in Europe. Second-wave finance was a recent phenomenon, and its component sectors did not have the same influence on continental political powers as did their first-wave finance peers. In most European countries other than the United Kingdom, second-wave financial sectors were still minority sectors. In Germany for instance, the hedge fund sector was almost nonexistent in 2008, France and Italy had some private equity and real estate funds, but their second-wave financial sectors were hardly comparable in size to British activity. The UK was at the forefront of European financialisation, and second-wave finance was on the verge of becoming a hegemonic force there.

In the past five decades British capitalism has gone through three successive political regimes of accumulation, each corresponding to a specific configuration of the financial sector. It was initially organised around a Fordist regime, with a strongly redistributive welfare state and a financial sector dominated by banks. Next came a financialised regime based on a regulatory state, in which finance was mostly concentrated in stock markets. Today we see the emergence of a new financialised regime, based on an increasingly authoritarian state: social and civil rights are restricted and alternative financial actors are able to make a profit in markets that were not financialised up to now. The new political regime of accumulation has not mechanically followed the rise in power of second-wave finance. A patient effort was needed to build a coalition of political interests, resolve institutional power struggles, and spread the new shared ideology, in order to turn the neoliberal regime into a libertarian-authoritarian one. This shift began in Britain at the same time as similar shifts in the United States and Brazil, with immediate consequences for other European countries. The change has strengthened second-wave financial actors in the UK, and they are beginning to dream of a more favourable political regime. It has weakened the neoliberal edifice at the heart of the European Union and put pressure on governments who, despite having the support of first-wave financial actors, are now asked to comply with the economic interests of alternative finance.

Since the mid-2000s this approach to the European Union has been supported by a growing body of critical work. The European construction has frequently been described as an undertaking meant to stifle democratic deliberation and ‘make European societies surrender to the process of capital accumulation’.10 In their book The Social Europe Will Never Exist, François Denord and Antoine Schwartz write that ‘the pro-business, free-market orientation of the European construction […] did not result from historical contingencies’ but was an inherent part of the European project itself.11 Wolfgang Streeck has also shown how the European Union subjected member states to ‘fiscal consolidation and debt discipline policies’ in order ‘to reassure the financial markets that in case of doubt their claims can and will have priority over those of citizens’.12 This institutional construction would replace the traditional duty of the state, the ‘duty to protect’ (the people), with the ‘duty to pay’ (the financial markets).

On this view, the powerlessness of European states was deliberately organised by those who nominally deplored it. In this respect, the EU is a convenient institutional alternative to explicit authoritarianism in the face of social movements provoked by the opportunities for ever greater capital accumulation granted to the dominant classes. Rather than using police force against the people, as anticipated by Rosa Luxemburg, the dominant classes have created technical and constitutional shields to prevent the people from taking part in economic decisions.16 In the end, European integration is a clever institutional innovation which conceals the beneficiaries of accumulation, prevents any form of contestation, and legitimates the disempowerment of the people and submission to the power of markets.

Throughout the 2000s, these intellectual organisations distilled the ideas that have accompanied the rise to financial and political power of second-wave finance. These entities are also places where economic actors who back the new political regime of accumulation forge ties and build coalitions. Their lists of board members and funding sources show that they represent the interests of second-wave finance, as well as those of other economic sectors (among them the construction, fossil fuel and tobacco industries). For such coalitions to emerge, the economic interests of their various members have to be reconciled, coordinated and collectively defended. This is the role of dedicated intellectual organisations. These think tanks follow a consistent ideological agenda. They are commonly designated as ‘Tufton Street’ think tanks, referring to the street in Westminster where most of them have their headquarters. The Adam Smith Institute, the TaxPayers’ Alliance, Leave Means Leave, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the Centre for Policy Studies and the Institute of Economic Affairs all have (or had: the IEA moved recently) addresses between 55 and 57 Tufton Street. This is not just a British network: Tufton Street is integrated in the transatlantic Atlas Foundation network of think tanks. The Atlas Foundation was created in 1981 by Anthony Fisher, then a Professor at the London School of Economics (LSE), close to Friedrich Hayek, and also the founder of the Institute of Economic Affairs. This network has its own quarterly magazine, Freedom’s Champion, and holds an annual conference called the Liberty Forums. Some 400 think tanks are members of the Atlas Foundation, most of them Anglo-American; they form a politically cohesive galaxy characterised by its libertarianism and its connections with the alt-right in the United States and with the radical fringes of the British Conservative Party. All the think tanks described below are members of the Atlas Foundation. The most emblematic members of this network in the United States are the Cato Institute funded by the Koch brothers, fossil fuel billionaires known for their denial of climate change and their libertarian opinions, and the Heritage Foundation, also a climate-change denying, libertarian and neoconservative group.

In this context, the contradiction between libertarian ideology and the restriction of public liberties is merely superficial. Even though the reduction of public liberties is not expressed as a core principle of libertarianism, it is one of its practical consequences. Under a regime that accepts inequalities and ignores the common good, and without any material mechanism to compensate for the impoverishment of significant segments of the population, the use of force is the only instrument left to regulate social life and enforce social order. Public liberties are sacrificed for the sake of the protection of the most essential of all liberties: the freedom to own and to accumulate.

Here our work echoes the research of US and European academics who since the mid-2010s have described the development of a new mode of social regulation based on repression and restriction of liberty.32 Our approach diverges from some of this work: we call this rising mode of population management ‘authoritarian’ rather than ‘totalitarian’, ‘fascist’ or ‘Bonapartist’. The notion of totalitarianism was popularised during the Cold War to portray communism and fascism as two strands of a similar mode of government, and thus drive a wedge into the united front of the right, the left and the far-left against European fascism that prevailed at the end of the Second World War.33 As for fascism, this construct posits an almighty state opposed to any form of individuality outside of the state, as individuals are inherently prone to insubordination. The contemporary rising authoritarianism that we describe consists solely in the glorification of individual potentialities, ruling out any form of collective solidarity or state protection.34 The authoritarianism we describe also diverges from Bonapartism, which as analysed by Marx provided theoretical grounds for the later analysis of fascism in the twentieth century. For Marx, Bonapartism is a form of bourgeois government that positions itself above social classes in order to govern and defend an order threatened by social movements.35 In circumstances where the property of the economically dominant classes is threatened, they are obliged to tolerate the existence of a state apparatus they do not directly control, and that enforces social order with enormous and relatively autonomous military and police powers.36 What we see today is not a transition to an autonomous state that would be mandated to resist the pressure of the rebellious working class. What we are witnessing is the merging of the dominant class and the state, a merger that threatens the economic, social and political existence of the dominated class. Marx described the surprise of the bourgeoisie when it realised that ‘the weapons with which [it had] felled feudalism to the ground were now turned against the bourgeoisie itself ’, and that it had ‘called into existence the men who were to wield those weapons – the proletarians’.37 This description does not match the situation of second-wave finance, as Brexit is not the result of a massive mobilisation of the working class against the new financialisation. The current authoritarianism is not a reaction to a potential working-class insurgency but rather a project, a manifesto and a pre-emptive strike.

For instance, James Goldsmith, the heir of an old family of Frankfurt bankers, made his name in the City of the 1970s by launching the first ‘corporate raids’ – hostile takeovers of industrial companies. This activity would soon become the core business of private equity funds, one of the key sectors of second-wave finance. Goldsmith was not only one of the founders of the private equity business model, he was also a leading figure of the Eurosceptic front. Immediately following the Maastricht treaty, he founded the Referendum Party, the first British party to call for a referendum on Brexit. Goldsmith was elected to the European Parliament on a list featuring leaders of the French far-right. He also espoused strongly anti-trade union positions and practices. Up to the 1980s he supported the British paramilitary organisation GB75, coordinated by former SAS captain David Stirling, which aimed to infiltrate and disrupt British trade unions, and prepared an action plan for a military coup in case of a socialist takeover in Britain. Goldsmith remained a major donor to British Conservative movements until his death in 1998, and steadfastly supported the most authoritarian options to combat social movements.

One has only to read the biographies of the main figures of the second-wave, pro-Brexit and libertarian financiers to perceive this hidden but strong alliance between economic deregulation and political authoritarianism.

The oft-heralded end of European neoliberalism as a dominant political regime of accumulation in Western countries is not the consequence of the manipulation of credulous voters, the xenophobic discourse of demagogues, new communication networks and the propagation of fake news that they make possible, or any other purely ideological process. It is not a matter of propaganda or influence exerted on the malleable minds of disoriented citizens. It is the project of a recent faction of the financial community in competition with older financial sectors. Driven by its own mode of capital accumulation, this new financial faction is determined to consolidate and even expand its enrichment opportunities, challenging the financial hegemony of first-wave financial actors. The new political regime anticipates the growing social tensions generated by the expansion of financial accumulation.

Second-wave finance has attained political hegemony at a time when capitalist logic is expanding towards new spaces beyond its present boundaries. This includes environmental resources. As David Harvey describes it, following the analyses of Rosa Luxemburg, ‘capitalism must perpetually have something “outside of itself ” in order to stabilize’.52 He refutes the Marxist thesis that the violent primitive accumulation of the past constituted the necessary and revolutionary basis for contemporary accumulation, but that it was now over and had left the floor to ‘expanded reproduction’, a process of accumulation that takes place via peaceful contractual relationships between capitalists and workers. His theory is that to maintain itself as the dominant mode of accumulation, capitalism has to constantly transform new things into commodities by building relationships (and often conflicts) with noncapitalist spaces of social life. These things can be public services, territories or living beings, and they are appropriated through what Harvey calls ‘dispossession’. ‘The general thrust of any capitalistic logic of power is not that territories should be held back from capitalist development, but that they should be continuously opened up.’53 For a time, dispossession occurred in the form of imperial conquest, privatisation and financialisation. It now occurs as the commodification of scarce environmental resources. The watchword of the actors supporting this new wave of appropriation can be summarised as follows: let us dispossess freely, without interference from either the European Union or national states, as we move to appropriate ecosystems and scarce environmental resources.

Our last observation is that this new political regime of accumulation does not aim for the sustainable reproduction of the dominant classes. It does not embody its own justification as do other forms of domination, which are posited variously on inherited wealth and privilege, academic merit, existential ascetism, innate charisma, taste for risk, or business acumen. It does not make any pretence of contributing to the common good or social progress. It does not even lay the grounds for the founding of secular dynasties of bold financiers. It does not create mythological figures dedicated to enlightening the masses. In other words, it is not built to last. It does not offer horizontal solidarity with the rest of the population to ensure minimal conditions of existence for people, nor does it celebrate vertical solidarity with ancestors and progeny, as it does not seek to legitimate and perpetuate domination. It is as if the dominant class ‘had been so convinced that there would be no future life for anyone that they decided to get rid as quickly as possible of all the burdens of solidarity’, whether material or symbolic.54

Another significant reason behind the increase of Mad incarcerated people in the nineteenth century was the passing of two Asylum Acts, which first allowed, and later mandated, counties to establish their own publicly funded mental asylums. Since the asylums were being built, counties would find people to fill them. Alongside the Poor Laws, this legislation laid the foundations of the modern welfare state;24 it was a way of managing poor, disabled and unruly bodyminds that could not be easily exploited for profit.25 While Madness and disability had always existed up until this point, this marked a significant moment in the state officially regulating, controlling and certifying Madness and disability. Since counties were taking Mad people into their care en masse, Madness became something that had to be examined and signed off on by state institutions, rather than something that just . . . was. Its boundaries had to be hardened, measured and, crucially, proven to be so incompatible with work that people couldn’t possibly labour in a factory. Therefore the line between Madness and sanity became dependent on the capitalist mode of production and managed by the state.

In 1971, a group of patients at Hartwood Hospital in Scotland established the first ‘Mental Patients’ Union’, through which they started to make demands to change their living conditions. Another union was established at Paddington Day Hospital in London, for which patients later established a headquarters in a Camden squat. Mental Patients’ Unions continued to spring up across the country, as well as other groups like Campaign Against Psychiatric Oppression (CAPO), Survivors Speak Out, the Hearing Voices Network and Community Organisation for Psychiatric Emergencies (COPE). In Germany, a revolutionary group called the Socialist Patients’ Collective (SPK) formed, which attempted to situate mental and physical illness in the context of capitalism. Many of these groups attempted to take care and treatment into their own hands – for example, Hackney Mental Patients’ Union let people in crisis crash in their squat, and SPK conducted ‘group agitations’, in which they tried to identify and remedy the material needs of patients. Each of these groups posed a radical challenge to individualised psychiatric control, emphasising collective care, political transformation and survivor agency.

In the Arab world, secularization was also part of the process of nationalization. Not surprisingly, it was mainly minorities, such as the Christians, that embraced warmly the idea of a secular national identity based on a shared territory, language, history, and culture. In Palestine, Christians who engaged with nationalism found eager allies among the Muslim elite, leading to a mushrooming of Muslim-Christian societies all over Palestine towards the end of World War I. In the Arab world, Jews joined these kind of alliances between activists from different religions. The same would have happened in Palestine had not Zionism demanded total loyalty from the veteran Jewish community there.

The ominous signs of how these seemingly religious and mythical beliefs might turn into a real program of colonization and dispossession appeared in Victorian Britain as early as the 1820s. A powerful theological and imperial movement emerged that would put the return of the Jews to Palestine at the heart of a strategic plan to take over Palestine and turn it into a Christian entity. In the nineteenth century, this sentiment became ever more popular in Britain and affected the official imperial policy: “The soil of Palestine … only awaits for the return of her banished children, and the application of industry, commensurate with agricultural capabilities, to burst once more into universal luxuriance, and be all that she ever was in the days of Solomon.”6 Thus wrote the Scottish peer and military commander John Lindsay. This sentiment was echoed by David Hartley, an English philosopher, who wrote: “It is probable that the Jews will be reinitiated in Palestine.”7

More to the point was the assumption of these policy makers that such a gesture would be welcomed by the American Jews, whom the British suspected of having a great influence in Washington. There was also a mixture of millenarianism and Islamophobia: David Lloyd George, the prime minister at the time and a devout Christian, favored the return of the Jews on a religious basis, and strategically both he and his colleagues preferred a Jewish colony to a Muslim one, as they saw the Palestinians, in the Holy Land.

Thus, in many ways, the strategic imperial impulse of Britain to use the Jewish return to Palestine as a means of deepening London’s involvement in the “Holy Land” coincided with the emergence of new cultural and intellectual visions of Zionism in Europe. For both Christians and Jews, therefore, the colonization of Palestine was seen as an act of return and redemption. The coincidence of the two impulses produced a powerful alliance that turned the anti-Semitic and millenarian idea of transferring the Jews from Europe to Palestine into a real project of settlement at the expense of the native people of Palestine. This alliance became public knowledge with the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration on November 2, 1917—a letter from the British foreign secretary to the leaders of the Anglo-Jewish community in effect promising them full support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

For both Christians and Jews, therefore, the colonization of Palestine was seen as an act of return and redemption. The coincidence of the two impulses produced a powerful alliance that turned the anti-Semitic and millenarian idea of transferring the Jews from Europe to Palestine into a real project of settlement at the expense of the native people of Palestine. This alliance became public knowledge with the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration on November 2, 1917—a letter from the British foreign secretary to the leaders of the Anglo-Jewish community in effect promising them full support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Thanks to the accessibility and efficient structure of the British archives, today we are blessed with many excellent scholarly works exploring the background to the declaration. Still among the best of them is an essay from 1970 by Mayer Verte, of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.22 He showed in particular how British officials asserted wrongly that Jewish members in the Bolshevik movement had similar aspirations to the Zionists, and that therefore a pro-Zionist declaration would pave the way for good relations with the new political power in Russia.

The bottom line of all the research hitherto conducted on the declaration is that the various decision makers in Britain saw the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine as coinciding with British strategic interests in the area. Once Britain had occupied Palestine, this alliance allowed the Jews to build the infrastructure for a Jewish state under British auspices, while protected by His Majesty’s Government’s bayonets.

Very few of them realized, or could have known, that most of the Kibbutzim were built on destroyed Palestinian villages, whose populations had been expelled in 1948. In justification, the Zionists claimed that these villages were old Jewish places mentioned in the Bible, and hence that their appropriation was not an occupation but a liberation. A special committee of “biblical archeologists” would enter a deserted village and determine what its name was in biblical times. Energetic officials of the Jewish National Fund would then establish the settlement with its newly recovered name.17 A similar method was used after 1967 by the then minister of labor, Yigal Alon, a secular socialist Jew, for building a new town near Hebron, since it “belonged” to the Jewish people, according to the Bible.

Similar references to genocide in the name of God appear in the Jewish Haggadah for Pesach (Passover). The main tale, of the Passover Seder—where God sends Moses and the Israelites to a land inhabited by others, to possess it as they see fit—is of course not an imperative issue for the vast majority of Jews. It is a literary text, not a manual for war. However, it can be exploited by the new stream of Jewish messianic thinking, as was the case with the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and, in the summer of 2015, the burning to death first of a teenager in one incident, and then of two parents and their baby in another. Israel’s new minister of justice, Ayelet Shaked, entertained similar ideas, so far only for Palestinians who have died in their attempts to resist Israel: their whole family, she said, should “follow their sons, nothing would be more just. They should go, as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes. Otherwise, more little snakes will be raised there.”21

The official Israeli narrative or foundational mythology refuses to allow the Palestinians even a modicum of moral right to resist the Jewish colonization of their homeland that began in 1882. From the very beginning, Palestinian resistance was depicted as motivated by hate for Jews. It was accused of promoting a protean anti-Semitic campaign of terror that began when the first settlers arrived and continued until the creation of the state of Israel. The diaries of the early Zionists tell a different story. They are full of anecdotes revealing how the settlers were well received by the Palestinians, who offered them shelter and in many cases taught them how to cultivate the land.4 Only when it became clear that the settlers had not come to live alongside the native population, but in place of it, did the Palestinian resistance begin.

Whether they were pan-Arabists, or local patriots, or wanted to be part of Greater Syria, the Palestinians were united in their wish not to be part of a Jewish state. Their leaders objected to any political solution that would hand any part of the small country to the settler community. As they clearly declared in their negotiations with the British at the end of the 1920s, they were willing to share with those who had already arrived, but could accept no more.9 The collective voice of the Palestinians was crystallized in the executive body of the Palestinian National Conference that met every year for a decade, starting in 1919. This body represented the Palestinians in their negotiations with both the British government and the Zionist movement. However, before that happened, the British tried to advance an agreement of equality between the parties. In 1928, the Palestinian leadership, notwithstanding the wishes of the overall majority of their people, consented to allow the Jewish settlers equal representation in the future bodies of the state. The Zionist leadership was in favor of the idea only for as long as it suspected the Palestinians would reject it. Shared representation stood against everything Zionism was supposed to be. So, when the proposal was accepted by the Palestinian party, it was rejected by the Zionists. This led to the riots of 1929, which included the massacre of Jews in Hebron and a much higher death toll among the Palestinian community.10 But there were also other reasons for the wave of violence, the most serious since the beginning of the Mandate. It was triggered by the dispossession of Palestinian tenants from land owned by absentee landlords and local notables, which had been bought by the Jewish National Fund. The tenants had lived for centuries on the land but they were now forced into slums in the towns. In one such slum, northeast of Haifa, the exiled Syrian preacher, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, recruited his first followers for an Islamic holy war against the British and the Zionist movement in the early 1930s. His legacy was ensured when his name was adopted by the military wing of the Hamas movement.

After 1930, the Palestinian leadership was institutionalized in the form of the Arab Higher Committee, a body that represented all the political parties and movements in the Palestinian community. Until 1937 it continued to attempt a compromise with the British government, but by then both the Zionists and the imperialists had ceased to care what the Palestinian point of view was, and went on unilaterally to determine the future of the territory. By this time the Palestinian national movement regarded Zionism as a colonialist project that had to be defeated. Yet even in 1947, when Britain decided to refer the question to the United Nations, the Palestinians suggested, with other Arab states, a unitary state in Palestine to replace the Mandate. The UN deliberated the fate of Palestine for seven months and had to decide between two options: the one suggested by the Palestinians of a unitary state that would absorb the existing Jewish settlers but would not allow any further Zionist colonization; the other suggesting a partition of the land into an Arab state and Jewish state. The UN preferred the latter option, and hence the message to Palestinians was: you cannot share your life on the land with the settlers—all you can hope for is to salvage half of it and concede the other half to the settlers.

As with all earlier settler colonial movements, the answer to these problems was the twin logic of annihilation and dehumanization. The settlers’ only way of expanding their hold on the land beyond the 7 percent, and of ensuring an exclusive demographic majority, was to remove the natives from their homeland. Zionism is thus a settler colonial project, and one that has not yet been completed. Palestine is not entirely Jewish demographically, and although Israel controls all of it politically by various means, the state of Israel is still colonizing—building new colonies in the Galilee, the Negev, and the West Bank for the sake of increasing the number of Jews there—dispossessing Palestinians, and denying the right of the natives to their homeland.

Psychiatric knowledge is also frequently damaging because of the dominance and power it holds in society. It is positioned as expert knowledge – bolstered by the institutional authority of science and medicine – and is therefore seen as more legitimate than knowledge that comes from people without power. This means that doctors and psychiatrists gain a monopoly on truth. They can diagnose and label us as they see fit, and override our knowledge of ourselves, or culturally derived knowledge. These decisions are also backed by the law. This power stems from the fact that, like the rest of medicine, psychiatry is seen to reveal internal, apolitical and ahistorical truths about our bodyminds, when, in actuality, its claims are socially and historically contextual, and closely tangled up in the demands of capitalist society. Psychiatry’s illnesses represent a production line approach to knowledge – they are framed not as one subjective way of knowing, but the objective way of knowing.

Questioning the way that we ‘know’ mental health doesn’t involve rejecting all current knowledge, or resisting the pursuit of knowledge in the first place. Rather, it is about finding new ways to orient ourselves towards knowledge. This involves scrutinising and disrupting how power and capital shape our understanding of ‘truth’. But it also means relinquishing the possibility of a final truth. We should resist the urge to authoritatively declare what mental health is and how we must know it. Politicising mental health does not demand having any sort of scientific or objective theory of what Mental Illness/Madness truly is.31 This question is a distraction – it hinges on the troublesome notion of an objective scientific reality – and can never yield a final or satisfying answer.

The activist Jonah Bossewitch has argued that, in our mental health politics, we need to move towards an ‘epistemological’ approach.32 By this, he means that we should not battle one another over how we must know mental health, but instead, embrace the infinite ways that we might know it. People think about and politicise their mental experiences differently. But these ideas do not necessarily have to be in competition. On the contrary, we can hold them together in solidarity. I also want us to be able to admonish the mindset of the omniscient scientist or investigator, looking to uncover and point towards a neat ‘answer’. Instead, it is important to be able to sit with multiple, contradictory knowledges. How, for example, can we know a tree? Through poetry – by creatively describing one? Through a roleplay – by pretending to be one? Through art – by painting a beautiful picture of one? Or perhaps through biology, mathematics, photography, gardening, smell, or maybe touch? There is no one way.

In the 1960s, the US psychiatrists Walter Bromberg and Franck Simon suggested that Malcolm X and the civil rights movement had sparked a wave of violent schizophrenic symptoms and paranoid ‘racial antagonism’ in Black Americans. As more Black people joined the movement and consciously dissented against the racist societal order, Bromberg and Simon dubbed this phenomenon ‘the protest psychosis’.10 The ongoing association between schizophrenia, violence and criminality undoubtedly still plays a role in the disproportionate number of Black people who are diagnosed. Black men, in particular, who experience mass criminalisation by the state, are now 10 times more likely to receive a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder than their white counterparts.11

For example, some psychiatrists have recently proposed the diagnostic term ‘residential school syndrome’ to describe the post-traumatic stress faced by survivors of Canada’s residential school system.23 These institutions, established by settler colonisers in the nineteenth century on Turtle Island,24 worked to eradicate the culture of indigenous First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples, and saw children separated from their families, beaten, sexually abused, malnourished, experimented on, neglected and killed by disease. But since medicine and psychiatry largely adopt an individualist approach to suffering, the medical concept of a syndrome serves to depoliticise the impacts of colonial violence, as argued by Fanon. Through the Western medical gaze, the focus is shifted to the trauma responses of indigenous people, to be remedied in the clinic rather than through structural or economic reparations.

The Zionists suggested that 80 percent of Palestine should be a Jewish state, while the rest could either become an independent Arab Palestinian state or be annexed and handed to the Kingdom of Jordan. Jordan itself was ambivalent towards the UN efforts as a result: on the one hand, they were being offered a possible extension of their arid kingdom into parts of fertile Palestine; on the other hand, they did not wish to be seen as betraying the Palestinian cause. The dilemma became even more acute when the Jewish leadership offered the Hashemites in Jordan an agreement to this effect. In a way, at the end of the 1948 war, Palestine was more or less divided in such a manner between the Zionist movement and Jordan.23

Interestingly, the USSR was even more loyal to the Zionist position and had no second thoughts at all. With the help of members of the Palestine Communist Party (PCP) they facilitated the supply of arms from Czechoslovakia to the Jewish forces before and after May 1948. Readers today may raise an eyebrow at this, but the PCP’s support for the Zionist cause was possible for two reasons. First the Soviet Union believed the new Jewish state would be socialist and anti-British (and therefore more inclined towards the Eastern Bloc in the emerging Cold War). Secondly, the PCP believed that national liberation was a necessary phase on the way to their more complete social revolution, and they recognized both the Palestinians and the Zionists as national movements (this is why the party still today supports the two-states solution).25

The various deliberations on this question ended on March 10, 1948, when the high command produced the infamous Plan Dalet, Plan D, which gave an indication of the fate of the Palestinians who lived in the areas to be occupied by the Jewish forces. The debates were led by the leader of the Jewish community, David Ben-Gurion, who was determined to secure demographic exclusivity for the Jews in any future state. This was an obsession that not only informed his actions before 1948, but also long after the creation of the state of Israel. As we shall see, this led him in 1948 to orchestrate the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, and in 1967 to oppose the occupation of the West Bank.

A study of the writings and thoughts of the early Zionist leaders shows that by 1948 this crime was inevitable. The goal of Zionism had not changed: it was dedicated to taking over as much of Mandatory Palestine as possible and removing most of the Palestinian villages and urban neighborhoods from the space carved out for the future Jewish state. The execution was even more systematic and comprehensive than anticipated in the plan. In a matter of seven months, 531 villages were destroyed and eleven urban neighborhoods emptied. The mass expulsion was accompanied by massacres, rape, and the imprisonment of males over the age of ten in labor camps for periods of over a year.30

If the legal lessons are not learned, there will always remain retributive impulses and revengeful emotions on the Palestinian side. The legal recognition of the 1948 Nakbah as an act of ethnic cleansing would pave the way for some form of restitutive justice. This would be the same as the process that has taken place recently in South Africa. The acknowledgement of past evils is not done in order to bring criminals to justice, but rather to bring the crime itself to public attention and trial.

The abolition of this regime in 1966 allowed a ready-made apparatus to control both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip even before the June 1967 war erupted. The military rule Israel had imposed on the Palestinian minority in 1948 was based on British Mandatory emergency regulations that treated the civilian population as a potential alien group, hence robbing it of its basic human and civil rights. Military governors were installed across the Palestinian areas with executive, judicial, and legislative authority. This was a quite a well-oiled machinery by 1966, including hundreds of employees who would serve as the nucleus for a similar regime when it was imposed on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

On the eve of 1967 war, all these factors played a role in the outbreak of violence. Two personalities, however, were no longer involved: David Ben-Gurion and Dag Hammarskjöld. Ben-Gurion had left the political scene in 1963. Ironically, it was only after his departure that the Greater Israel lobby was able to plan its next step. Until then, Ben-Gurion’s demographic obsession had prevented the takeover of the West Bank, but also produced the by now familiar military rule Israel had imposed on different Palestinian groups. The abolition of this regime in 1966 allowed a ready-made apparatus to control both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip even before the June 1967 war erupted. The military rule Israel had imposed on the Palestinian minority in 1948 was based on British Mandatory emergency regulations that treated the civilian population as a potential alien group, hence robbing it of its basic human and civil rights.

The second decision was that the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would not be incorporated into the state of Israel as citizens. This did not include the Palestinians living in what Israel regarded at the time as the new “Greater Jerusalem” area. The definition of that area, and who in it was entitled to Israeli citizenship, changed whenever this space grew in size. The greater the Greater Jerusalem became, the larger the number of Palestinians in it. Today there are 200,000 Palestinians within what is defined as the Greater Jerusalem area. To ensure that not all of them are counted as Israeli citizens, quite a few of their neighborhoods were declared to be West Bank villages.20 It was clear to the government that denying citizenship on the one hand, and not allowing independence on the other, condemned the inhabitants of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to life without basic civil and human rights.

Another way of judging what the real Israeli intentions have been since 1967 is to look at these policies from the point of view of the Palestinian victims. After the occupation, the new ruler confined the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in an impossible limbo: they were neither refugees nor citizens—they were, and still are, citizenless inhabitants. They were inmates, and in many respects still are, of a huge prison in which they have no civil and human rights and no impact on their future. The world tolerates this situation because Israel claims—and the claim was never challenged until recently—that the situation is temporary and will continue only until there is a proper Palestinian partner for peace. Not surprisingly, such a partner has not been found. At the time of writing, Israel is still incarcerating a third generation of Palestinians by various means and methods, and depicting these mega-prisons as temporary realities that will change once peace comes to Israel and Palestine.

The worst part of this supposed “enlightened occupation” has been the government’s methods for managing the territories. At first the area was divided into “Arab” and potential “Jewish” spaces. Those areas densely populated with Palestinians became autonomous, run by local collaborators under a military rule. This regime was only replaced with a civil administration in 1981. The other areas, the “Jewish” spaces, were colonized with Jewish settlements and military bases. This policy was intended to leave the population both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in disconnected enclaves with neither green spaces nor any possibility for urban expansion.

Finally, under the “enlightened occupation,” settlers have been allowed to form vigilante gangs to harass people and destroy their property. These gangs have changed their approach over the years. During the 1980s, they used actual terror—from wounding Palestinian leaders (one of them lost his legs in such an attack), to contemplating blowing up the mosques on Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem. In this century, they have engaged in the daily harassment of Palestinians: uprooting their trees, destroying their yields, and shooting randomly at their homes and vehicles. Since 2000, there have been at least 100 such attacks reported per month in some areas such as Hebron, where the 500 settlers, with the silent collaboration of the Israeli army, harassed the locals living nearby in an even more brutal way.15

House demolition is not a new phenomenon in Palestine. As with many of the more barbaric methods of collective punishment used by Israel since 1948, it was first conceived and exercised by the British Mandatory government during the Great Arab Revolt of 1936–39. This was the first Palestinian uprising against the pro-Zionist policy of the British Mandate, and it took the British army three years to quell it. In the process, they demolished around 2,000 houses during the various collective punishments meted out to the local population.13 Israel demolished houses from almost the first day of its military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The army blew up hundreds of homes every year in response to various acts undertaken by individual family members.14 From minor violations of military rule to participation in violent acts against the occupation, the Israelis were quick to send in their bulldozers to wipe out not only a physical building but also a focus of life and existence. In the greater Jerusalem area (as inside Israel) demolition was also a punishment for the unlicensed extension of an existing house or the failure to pay bills. Another form of collective punishment that has recently returned to the Israeli repertoire is that of blocking up houses. Imagine that all the doors and windows in your house are blocked by cement, mortar, and stones, so you can’t get back in or retrieve anything you failed to take out in time. I have looked hard in my history books to find another example, but found no evidence of such a callous measure being practiced elsewhere.

Before we answer these questions, we should remember the reality in the occupied territories on the day Arafat left for Camp David. My main argument here is that Arafat came to Camp David to change that reality while the Israelis and the Americans arrived there determined to maintain it. The Oslo process had transformed the occupied territories into a geography of disaster, which meant that the Palestinians’ quality of life was far worse after the Accord that it was before. Already in 1994, Rabin’s government forced Arafat to accept its interpretation of how the Accord would be implemented on the ground. The West Bank was divided to the infamous areas A, B, and C. Area C was directly controlled by Israel and constituted half of the West Bank. The movement between, and inside, these areas became nearly impossible, and the West Bank was cut off from the Gaza Strip. The Strip was also divided between Palestinians and Jewish settlers, who took over most of the water resources and lived in gated communities cordoned off with barbered wire. Thus the end result of this supposed peace process was a deterioration in the quality of Palestinian lives.

Another common reference in the blame game Israel and the United States played after the failure at Camp David was that of reminding public opinion that there was a chronic problem with Palestinian leaders, who at the moment of truth would expose their warmongering ways. The claim that “there is no one to talk to on the Palestinian side” resurfaced in that period as a common analysis from pundits and commentators in Israel, Europe, and the United States. Such allegations were particularly cynical. The Israeli government and army had tried by force to impose its own version of Oslo—one that was meant to perpetuate the occupation forever but with Palestinian consent—and even an enfeebled Arafat could not accept it. He and so many other leaders who could have led their people to reconciliation were targeted by the Israelis, and most of them, including probably Arafat himself, were assassinated. The targeted killing of Palestinian leaders, including moderate ones, was not a new phenomenon in the conflict. Israel began this policy in 1972 with the assassination of Ghassan Kanafani, a poet and writer who also could have led his people to reconciliation. The fact that he was targeted, as a secular and leftist activist, is symbolic of the role Israel played in killing those Palestinians it later “regretted” not being there as partners for peace.

The second myth I examine concerns the Israeli decision that created the vacuum in the Gaza Strip which enabled Hamas not only to win the elections in 2006 but also to oust Fatah by force in the same year. This was the 2005 unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Strip after nearly forty years of occupation. The second myth is that this withdrawal was a gesture of peace or reconciliation, which was reciprocated by hostility and violence. It is crucial to debate, as I do in this chapter, the origins of the Israeli decision and to look closely at the impact it has had on Gaza ever since. In fact, I claim that the decision was part of a strategy intended to strengthen Israel’s hold over the West Bank and to turn the Gaza Strip into a mega-prison that could be guarded and monitored from the outside. Israel not only withdrew its army and secret service from the Strip but also pulled out, in a very painful process, the thousands of Jewish settlers the government had sent there since 1969. So, I will claim that viewing this decision as a peaceful gesture is a myth. It was more a strategic deployment of forces that enabled Israel to respond harshly to the Hamas victory, with disastrous consequences for the population of Gaza.

In 2009, Avner Cohen, who served in the Gaza Strip around the time Hamas began to gain power in the late 1980s, and was responsible for religious affairs in the occupied territories, told the Wall Street Journal, “the Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel’s creation.”7 Cohen explains how Israel helped the charity al-Mujama al-Islamiya (the “Islamic Society”), founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 1979, to become a powerful political movement, out of which the Hamas movement emerged in 1987. Sheikh Yassin, a crippled, semi-blind Islamic cleric, founded Hamas and was its spiritual leader until his assassination in 2004. He was originally approached by Israel with an offer of help and the promise of a license to expand. The Israelis hoped that, through his charity and educational work, this charismatic leader would counterbalance the power of the secular Fatah in the Gaza Strip and beyond. It is noteworthy that in the late 1970s Israel, like the United States and Britain, saw secular national movements (whose absence today they lament) as the worst enemy of the West.

For those who considered themselves to the left of the Likud, Sharon’s move was a peace gesture, and a brave confrontation with the settlers. He became a hero of the left as well of the center and moderate right, like de Gaulle taking the pied noir out of Algeria for the sake of peace.

On December 28, 2006, the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem published its annual report on the atrocities in the occupied territories. In that year Israeli forces killed 660 citizens, more than triple that of the previous year when around 200 Palestinians were killed. According to B’Tselem, in 2006, 141 children were among the dead. Most of the casualties were from the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli forces demolished almost 300 houses and crushed entire families. This means that since 2000, almost 4,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, half of them children; more than 20,000 were wounded.27

The myth insists that the Jews who arrived in 1882 were the descendants of the Jews expelled by the Romans around 70 CE. The counterargument questions this genealogical connection. Quite a hefty scholarly effort has shown that the Jews of Roman Palestine remained on the land and were first converted to Christianity and then to Islam. Who these Jews were is still an open question—maybe the Khazars who converted to Judaism in the ninth century; or maybe the mixture of races across a millennium precludes any answer to such a question. More importantly, I argue in this chapter that in the pre-Zionist period the connection between the Jewish communities in the world and Palestine was religious and spiritual, not political.

Refugees in the camp would retaliate against the settlers by throwing stones. I started throwing stones at age ten. Kids a little older might be a little more organized. Different groups of kids would decide to do something—a group of five over here, a group of six over there. By the time I was thirteen, I was among them. We started to incite other children to put flags up. At that time, it was illegal to hang the Palestinian flag.9 So, we would tell the kids to hang the flag and to write slogans on the walls. That was also illegal then. You could be arrested by the Israeli army and go to prison. When they saw us throwing stones, the soldiers or settlers might shoot. When they shot at us, yes, we were afraid. But with time, with all the injustice and the frustration, we were just stuck, and we didn’t care if we died. But we thought throwing stones made a difference. We saw the settlers as the occupiers, and they were the source of injustice and deprivation, so we had to fight back. This was before the First Intifada, but for us in the camp it was already Intifada—it was always Intifada.10

1993—After months of talks in secret, Israel and the PLO sign the Oslo Peace Accords. For the first time, the PLO formally recognizes Israel’s existence as a state, and Israel formally recognizes the Palestinian people and the PLO. The agreement establishes the Palestinian Authority, which will govern Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank on an interim basis. Israel also promises to freeze settlement construction in the occupied territories. While there is some disagreement among historians about where to mark the end of the First Intifada, most place it at either the Oslo Accords or the 1991 Madrid conference. 1995—September: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat sign another peace accord, known as Oslo II, that solidifies some of the principles set out in the 1993 Oslo Accords. Oslo II sets deadlines for Palestinian elections, negotiations on permanent status, and land concessions from Israel. —November: Amid unrest from the ultra-Orthodox and extremist Israeli settlers in reaction to Oslo II’s proposed land concessions, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is assassinated by Israeli citizen Yigal Amir. The assassination and its fallout disrupt the peace process severely. 1996—Israel’s next elected prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, lifts a four-year freeze on settlement expansion in the territories without consulting Yasser Arafat. Settlements expand rapidly. Over the next decade, the population of settlers in the West Bank alone doubles from roughly 125,000 to 250,000.

In 2010, after the spate of suicides at Foxconn’s Shenzhen factory, the manufacturer offered employees counselling as a ‘solution’ to inhumane working conditions, as well as erecting ‘anti-suicide nets’ below the roof of the building to prevent further deaths.44 In 2021, after years of bad press, Amazon introduced new mental health benefits for all US employees.45 These examples are disparate and extreme, but still speak to the overarching capitalist ethos that workers’ suffering is an inevitability, and one that can only be remedied on an individual, retrospective basis through the lens of ‘mental health support’. Employers keep our bodyminds healthy and well to allow better exploitation within the very system that is harming us. All the while, they create an impression that profit has a moral compass, that it cares about us.

Work is not only destructive to our mental health. We should also go further to think about how our very notion of ‘mental health’ is constructed in relation to capitalist work. Historically, changes to the conditions of production have ushered in changes in society’s understanding of Madness, illness and disability. As we discussed in Chapter 1, the industrial revolution and the emergence of capitalism saw a societal shift from slower, autonomous work in the home to fast-paced, disciplined factory work. This process excluded many people who had previously either been able to participate in the production process, or be cared for in the home.46

Dyslexia, a diagnosis I have been given, also started to be widely recognised and regulated in the twentieth century, as the middle classes emerged and the market began to shift away from manual labour.51 These changes meant that age-graded schooling became a compulsory requirement to enter the job market, and children were expected to acquire particular skills at a standardised rate.52 It is only within this context that a child’s reading ability could be diagnosed as falling out of line with the social order, or ‘disordered’. My dyslexia was not diagnosed on the basis of my spelling or my ability to recognise words, but because my reading speed is ‘too slow’. ‘Too slow’ for what? Could I be dyslexic in a world without the classroom or the clock? ADHD diagnoses have followed a similar trajectory as work and education have made greater demands on our attention.53

Under capitalism, being able to sell our labour is the definition of mental health, with ‘work’ being referenced almost 400 times in the DSM-5.54 As a result, the common denominator between almost all experiences categorised as Mental Illness is that they, in some way or another, diminish our productivity in work or education (or are otherwise disruptive to the social order in capitalist society). This is reflected in employment statistics – Madness/Mental Illness is the most common reason for benefits claims, at almost 50%.55 While suffering is often a component of Madness/Mental Illness, it is not a precursor. Even when people with particular mental experiences are not actually in distress – for example, someone who hears voices and sees it as a spiritual experience – their bodymind may still be categorised as ‘ill’, because these experiences often limit a person’s ability to labour under capitalism.

If we want to organize the world as it was two thousand years ago, we will end up with a huge insane asylum. Nor does a religious link to a holy place confer any rights on it: this is true for Zionists today as it was for the Crusaders of yesterday. On this point, I must point out that this position does not lead me to deny the right of the state of Israel to exist. I have said time and again that a child born of rape has the right to live. The fact is there: refugees from Europe in the wake of the terrible Nazi genocide were forced to join the Zionist enterprise, to emigrate and settle on the land of another population. What has been done cannot be undone without creating a new series of tragedies. We can only repair the injustice as far as possible, provide compensation, and above all keep in mind in any negotiation the fundamental injustice inflicted on the inhabitants by the newcomers they had not invited.

In writing this book, in my great naivete, I set out in search of scholarly work on the exile of the Jewish population from ancient Judea/Palestine. I remember hours spent on this pursuit at the Tel Aviv University library and on the Internet. As I could not find a single research work on the subject, I approached historians who were specialists in antiquity to ask for their help. Their answer was succinct: there was no book on this subject because the Judeans were not uprooted by force; they simply emigrated and dispersed following the repression of the great revolts. Surprised by this answer, I asked them for a bibliography on the mass emigration. I was told that, given the scarcity of evidence, it was impossible to conduct any research. After the collapse, in my historical consciousness, of the legendary account of the “exodus from Egypt,” the turn came for the myth of the “exile of the Jewish people.” The inhabitants of Judea, being agriculturalists, never abandoned their land, because peasants do not give up their vital resources unless they are absolutely forced to do so by great poverty and famine. There is no evidence of camps of emigrants and refugees clustered on the borders of Judea at the time or of Jewish Aramaic- or Hebrew-speaking colonies on the Mediterranean coast. Unlike the Greeks and the Phoenicians, the inhabitants of Judea were not navigators.

Two questions then immediately came to mind: 1) Where did the many Jewish believers present in Alexandria, Damascus, Rome, Cyprus, Cyrenaica and other regions and cities of the Mediterranean basin came from? 2) What was the fate of the population left in Judea/Palestine after the destruction of its great temple? A careful reading of ancient Roman literature and Jewish writings soon revealed to me an open secret: from the time of the Hasmonaeans, in the second century BCE, Judaism was clearly a proselytizing monotheism that experienced rapid expansion within the Hellenistic world. It was this popularization of Judaism that paved the way for the subsequent arrival of its two younger sisters, Christianity and Islam; their victory put a stop to conversions to Judaism, which at the same time became a dangerous foreigner whose traces they tried to hide. In the fourth century CE, with the victory of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire, the indigenous population of Palestine gradually began to change religion, as evidenced by the appearance of churches in Jerusalem and other sites in Judea and Galilee. However, the gap between the fundamental principles of Judaism and those of Christianity was too wide: the notion of the Son of God upset the rabbis. At the time of the Muslim conquest in the seventh century, however, the majority of the population effectively abandoned their old Jewish beliefs and rallied to the new prophet, who did not claim to be the Son of God and, after all, respected the Old Testament. It seems that there was an additional reason for Islamization: during the first phase of conquest, anyone who embraced the cult of Mohammed was exempt from paying taxes. There was therefore not a population replacement but a religious replacement. Does this mean that the direct descendants of the ancient children of Israel are the Palestinians? Not exactly. Successive conquerors all left their seed and their seal on the region, and there are no “pure” populations.

Communities of Jewish believers, who converted at various historical times, have always been the repositories of a rich and fascinating religious culture, but have not shared a culture as a people or a common language. A Jew from Casablanca could not communicate with a Jew from Kiev; they did not like the same food and would have found the others clothing strange. On the other hand, they could have prayed in the same synagogue, despite differences in the formulation of prayers and liturgical singing.

For Israelis, specifically those of Jewish origin, such mythologies are farfetched, whereas their own history rests on firm and precise truths. They know for a certainty that a Jewish nation has been in existence since Moses received the tablets of the law on Mount Sinai, and that they are its direct and exclusive descendants (except for the ten tribes, who are yet to be located). They are convinced that this nation “came out” of Egypt; conquered and settled “the Land of Israel,” which had been famously promised it by the deity; created the magnificent kingdom of David and Solomon, which then split into the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. They are also convinced that this nation was exiled, not once but twice, after its periods of glory—after the fall of the First Temple in the sixth century BCE, and again after the fall of the Second Temple, in 70 CE. Yet even before that second exile, this unique nation had created the Hebrew Hasmonean kingdom, which revolted against the wicked influence of Hellenization.

The current dominant way of thinking about disability draws on the ‘medical model’. This model operates on the key idea that disability is a problem located inside the body, which needs to be fixed, usually through engaging with the institution of medicine. But in the 1970s, the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) – a radical group of physically disabled, London-based Marxists4 – tried to articulate a new way of thinking about disability. They wrote: In our view, it is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments, by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society. Disabled people are therefore an oppressed group in society. It follows from this analysis that having low incomes, for example, is only one aspect of our oppression. It is a consequence of our isolation and segregation, in every area of life, such as education, work, mobility, housing, etc.5

People who experience chronic illness, pain and fatigue, in particular, have often said that elements of their conditions are inherently disabling, and would be in any society. Alison Kafer argues: Social and structural changes will do little to make one’s joints stop aching or to alleviate back pain. Nor will changes in architecture and attitude heal diabetes or cancer or fatigue. Focusing exclusively on disabling barriers, as a strict social model seems to do, renders pain and fatigue irrelevant to the project of disability politics.10

Peoples, populations, native populaces, tribes and religious communities are not nations, even though they are often spoken of as such. To be sure, as cultural building materials they have been vital in the fashioning of the new national identities, but they lack the decisive characteristics that total modernity, falling upon them like a raptor, carries below its wings.

For the present purpose, it is the original definition that he offers in his book that is most significant: “the nation … is an imagined political community—and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.”20 Indeed, every community that is bigger than a tribe or a village is imagined, because its members do not know one another; such were the great religious communities before modern times. But the nation has new tools for people’s imaginary belonging to it that were unavailable to the old societies.

Many scholars expressed reservations about certain premises in Gellner’s thesis.22 Did nationalism always wait for complete industrialization before hoisting its flags and symbols? Had there been no national feelings—no aspirations for sovereignty—in early capitalism, before the rise of a complex, developed division of labor? Some of the criticism was persuasive, but it did not detract from Gellner’s important philosophical achievement in determining that the advanced consolidation of a nation is closely connected with the formation of a unified culture, such as can exist only in a society that is no longer agrarian and traditional.

Diagnosis is a tool.

As we have established throughout the course of this book so far, biomedical approaches are blinkered and inadequate lenses for collectively understanding and caring for our bodyminds. They are rooted in murky histories, they turn our attention away from the political world, and obscure the ways in which our societal context constructs illness and disability.

By connecting our struggles and standing shoulder to shoulder, we refuse to disavow one another. These forms of solidarity with ‘disorderly’ people can ripple further out to other members of the ‘surplus class’ – which includes all those deemed to be disruptive to the capitalist system. For example, we should stand by people who are criminalised, rather than arguing that Mad/ Mentally Ill people should be treated better, because they ‘aren’t criminals’.14 We must continue to ask: what do each of us share with one another under the capitalist economic system? How can we liberate one another?

The disability activist Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha describes prefiguration as: ‘waking up and acting as if the revolution has happened.’8 These actions might be big or small, experimental or methodical. Either way, they are about bringing the futures that only exist in our most distant imaginations into the present. While we might say that the political and economic conditions that would allow these worlds to be fully realised do not currently exist, prefiguration argues that we already have many of the tools and capabilities, that the world we want already exists in ‘fragments and pieces, experiments and possibilities.’9

Much like centres in Trieste, crisis houses are often part of residential streets, like Drayton Park Women’s Crisis House in London. Unlike psychiatric wards, some crisis houses, like Link House in Bristol, give guests the option to put objects that could be used to self-injure in a box in their bedroom, which they hold the keys to. Guests also have the choice to give the keys to staff, with the option of having a conversation with staff members about their feelings before choosing whether to access the keys. Former Link House guest, Jennifer Reese, has written: This put me in control of my own body again. In hospital I was stealing scissors from the art room to hurt myself, hitting my head on the walls . . . At Link House I kept the keys to the sharps box myself.

Anti-austerity leftists today, however, argue that we need to fund and expand mental healthcare. To avoid history repeating itself, we need to acknowledge in this climate that the reality is, paradoxically, both: of course we need more funding and resources, but we will not see revolutionary change if funding is pumped into carceral state structures that grew from the seeds of capitalism, not care. If abolition is about building ‘life-affirming institutions’, we need to invest in completely transformed approaches that sprout from different soil, divorced from the legacy of the capitalist asylum.

Every social class, coming into existence on the original basis of an essential function in the world of economic production, creates with itself, organically, one or more groups of intellectuals who give it homogeneity and consciousness of its function.47 To retain control for a long time, it is not enough to possess visible power; it is necessary to produce ethical and legal norms. An educated stratum provides a hegemonic consciousness to underpin the class structure, so that it will not need to keep defending that structure by violent means.

Universal education and the creation of agreed cultural codes were preconditions for the complex specializations demanded by the modern division of labor. Therefore every state that became “nationalized,” whether authoritarian or liberal, made elementary education a universal right. No mature nation failed to declare education compulsory, obliging its citizens to send their children off to school. This institution, which became the central agent of ideology—rivaled only by the military and by war—turned all subjects into citizens, namely, people conscious of their nationality.56 If Joseph de Maistre maintained that the executioner was the mainstay of social order in the state, Gellner’s provocative insight was that the decisive role in the state belonged to none other than the educator.57 More than to their rulers, the new national citizens became loyal to their culture.

Although he was never a complete Zionist, Graetz formed the national mold for the writing of Jewish history. He succeeded in creating, with great virtuosity, a unified narrative that minimized problematic multiplicity and created an unbroken history, branching but always singular. Likewise, his basic periodization—bridging chasms of time, and erasing gaps and breaches in space—would serve future Zionist historians, even when they renovated and reshaped it. Henceforth, for many people, Judaism would no longer be a rich and diverse religious civilization that managed to survive despite all difficulties and temptations in the shadow of giants, and became an ancient people or race that was uprooted from its homeland in Canaan and arrived in its youth at the gates of Berlin. The popular Christian myth about the wandering Jew, reproduced by rabbinical Judaism in the early centuries of the Common Era, had acquired a historian who began to translate it into a prenational Jewish narrative.

In 1882 the well-known biblical scholar Julius Wellhausen published his Prolegomena to the History of Israel, which became the most authoritative work of biblical commentary of its time.41 Wellhausen summarized and developed, by an ingenious and complex synthesis, a century of research that had attempted to date the composition of different parts of the ancient work. A brilliant philological analysis led him to doubt the historicity of some of the biblical stories and to conclude that certain key passages were written long after the events they described. As he saw it, the Jewish religion had developed in stages, and every layer in the Pentateuch indicated a different date of composition. Graetz launched a furious attack on this “anti-Jewish” work (and, as we shall see, almost all the Jewish-nationalist historians would follow his example).

Dubnow’s narrative strategy would be adopted by all the Zionist historians who followed him—namely, that the Bible is indeed full of imaginary tales, but its historical core is trustworthy. Why? Because the legendary quality was added by later popular tradition and literary modification, which adapted the living “people’s memory” that had been preserved, and which testified to a long and natural historical sequence.

It was necessary only to know how to interpret them so as to provide a scientific basis for the stories of the early Jewish people. Here Dubnow initiated a lasting tradition in Jewish nationalism, which in later years would deploy digging implements to substantiate biblical stories—and with them, of course, the proprietary claim of the “People of Israel” to the “Land of Israel.” At that time, archaeology, like historiography, was not yet Zionist, but already the Christian excavators took pains not to contradict the Old Testament, which might undermine the New Testament. What was a prenationalist or nationalist historian to do if a contradiction nevertheless emerged? In the creation of the national narrative, he would always prefer the “truth” of the theological text over the archaeological finding.

If Graetz in his writing opposed Treitschke, Baer in his writing opposed the German historians who had formed him, and who by and large greeted the new Nazi regime with understanding, if not enthusiasm. In 1936 the expulsion of Jews from the feverish body of the German nation was at one of its high points, and the Zionist historian, harshly rejected by his native Germany, completed the process by developing a painful counterconsciousness. Ironically, this self-consciousness drew on the same imaginary idea of nationhood that had nurtured his mentors for several generations: that the source determines the substance, and the goal is a return to the roots, the primeval habitat, be it Teutonic or Hebrew.

If Graetz was responsible for the foundation and scaffolding of the retroactive construction of the Jewish nation, Dinur laid the bricks, hung the beams, and fitted the windows and doors. He did this in two ways: as a teacher of Jewish history, he took part with Baer in shaping the power relations in this field of research; as a party cultural activist in the Zionist left, a member of the first Knesset, and from 1951 the minister of education for the State of Israel, he was the chief architect of all history studies in the Hebrew educational systems.79

The charismatic leader was not only a keen reader of the ancient Hebrew book; he also made cunning political use of it. Quite early he realized that the holy book could be made into a secular national text, serve as a central repository of ancient collective imagery, help forge the hundreds of thousands of new immigrants into a unified people, and tie the younger generation to the land. The biblical stories served him as a basis for everyday political rhetoric, and seemingly he genuinely identified with Moses and Joshua. Much as the leaders of the French Revolution felt they were assuming the roles of ancient Roman senators, so Ben-Gurion and other leaders of the Zionist revolution, senior military figures, and national intellectuals felt they were recapitulating the biblical conquest of Canaan and the construction of a state along the lines of David’s kingdom. Current action became significant in the context of paradigmatic events of the past. In both cases the revolutionaries dreamed of creating a completely new man, but the materials they used in his construction were taken from a mythical past. In Ben-Gurion’s imagination the new Israel was the kingdom of Third Temple, and when the Israeli armed forces captured the entire Sinai peninsula in the 1956 war and reached Sharm el-Sheikh, he addressed the victorious troops with messianic passion: We can once more sing the song of Moses and the Children of Ancient Israel … With the mighty impetus of all the IDF divisions you have extended a hand to King Solomon, who developed Eilat as the first Israelite port three thousand years ago … And Yotvata, called Tiran, which until fourteen hundred years ago was an independent Hebrew state, will become a part of the third kingdom of Israel.91

In 1964 Professor Aharoni, one of Israel’s leading archaeologists, published a popular work, Atlas of the Bible, which informed a whole generation about ancient geography and the movements in it of all the principal biblical figures.110 The wanderings of Abraham and Jacob, the Exodus from Egypt, the entry of the Israelite spies into Canaan, the transporting of the ark, Saul’s search for the she-asses, the movements of David’s troops, and the trade routes of Solomon’s kingdom—all were neatly fitted with the extrabiblical archaeological discoveries, producing an impressive visual sequence. It was the geographic, and hence a more effective, equivalent of Dinur’s old book: nothing looks more positive and reassuring than a detailed piece of cartography. The maps’ seeming reality was highly convincing, and rounded off the verbal abstractions of the historians and Bible scholars. Needless to say, the atlas did not depict the narrow boundaries of the State of Israel at the time of publication, but only those of the powerful kingdoms of David and Solomon, as well as the battle moves of the various Israelite heroes. Not surprisingly, Aharoni was one of the first signatories of “The Whole Eretz Israel,” a petition drafted following the Six-Day War in 1967, which called on all future governments of Israel never to cede an inch of the ancient homeland.

Archaeological excavations in various locations have also shown that the inhabitants of the mountainous northern region were, like the peasants in Judah, devout polytheists. They worshipped the popular Yahweh, who gradually became, like the Greek Zeus and the Roman Jupiter, the central deity, but they did not forsake the cults of other deities, such as Baal, Shemesh and the beautiful Asherah.117 The authors of the Pentateuch, who were late Judean monotheists, detested the rulers of Israel but were no less envious of their legendary power and glory. They expropriated their prestigious name—“Israel,” which was probably well established—while never desisting from the denunciation of their moral and religious transgressions.

The theory of the Copenhagen-Sheffield school—Thomas L. Thompson, Niels Peter Lemche, Philip Davies and others122—is more convincing, even if we do not adopt every one of its assumptions and conclusions. It says, in effect, that the Bible is not a book but a grand library that was written, revised and adapted in the course of three centuries, from the late sixth to the early second BCE. It should be read as a multilayered literary construction of a religious and philosophical nature or as theological parables that sometimes employ quasi-historical descriptions for educational purposes, aimed especially at future generations (as the system of divine punishment often punishes the descendants for their forebears’ transgressions).123

Jewish monotheism began to take shape among the cultural elites who were forcibly deported after the fall of the kingdom of Judah in the sixth century BCE, and the imagery of exile and wandering already reverberates, directly or metaphorically, in a major part of the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings (the final section of the Old Testament).

THE “PEOPLE” EXILED IN 70 CE It must first of all be emphasized that the Romans never deported entire peoples. We might add that neither did the Assyrians and Babylonians move entire populations from the countries they conquered. It did not pay to uproot the people of the land, the cultivators of produce, the taxpayers. But even the efficient policy of deportation practiced by the Assyrian, and later the Babylonian, empire—in which whole sections of local administrative and cultural elites were deported—was not followed by the Roman Empire. Here and there in the western Mediterranean countries, local farming communities were displaced to make room for the settling of Roman soldiers, but this exceptional policy was not applied in the Near East.

Israel Jacob Yuval, a historian at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, went further. He proposed to show that the renewed Jewish myth about the exile in fact arose fairly late, and was due mainly to the rise of Christian mythology about the Jews being exiled in punishment for their rejection and crucifixion of Jesus.12 It seems that the source of the discourse regarding the anti-Jewish exile lies in the writings of Justin Martyr, who in the mid-second century linked the expulsion of circumcised men from Jerusalem after the Bar Kokhba revolt with divine collective punishment.13 He was followed by other Christian authors who regarded the presence of Jews outside their sacred land as the punishment and proof of their sins. The myth of exile began to be slowly appropriated and integrated into Jewish tradition.

The start of the “exile-without-expulsion” was different from the exile that Jewish tradition mistakenly dated to the fall of the Temple in the first century CE—the long exile was in fact considerably shorter, because it began only with the Arab conquest. This exile-without-expulsion, which began in the seventh century CE—that is, some six centuries after the fall of the Second Temple—was not Yitzhak Baer’s invention alone. This astonishing discovery was made by other Zionist scholars as well, notably Baer’s friend and historiographical comrade-in-arms, Ben-Zion Dinur.

Every monotheism contains a potential element of mission. Unlike the tolerant polytheisms, which accept the existence of other deities, the very belief in the existence of a single god and the negation of plurality impels the believers to spread the idea of divine singularity that they have adopted. The acceptance by others of the worship of the single god proves his might and his unlimited power over the world. Despite the isolationist caste tendency implanted in the Jewish religion in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, which would return in response to the harsh strictures of the triumphant Christian church, it was not as exceptional in propagating monotheism as many think. Heterodox voices in the Old Testament calling on the gentiles to acknowledge Yahweh are found not only in Isaiah but also in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Zephaniah, Zechariah and the Book of Psalms.

We have seen that Cicero had already noted the large presence of Jewish believers in Rome in the first century BCE, and it is known that many followers of Yahweh took part in the funeral of Julius Caesar. So it is well to remember that this substantial presence existed for a long time before the war of 70 CE, and had nothing to do with any imaginary “mass expulsions” from Judea after the fall of the kingdom and the Bar Kokhba revolt. Most Roman sources indicate that this presence was due to the spread of the Jewish religion. As the rate of conversion to Judaism intensified, so did the government’s disquiet and the resentment on the part of many Latin intellectuals.

Under repressive Christianity, it gradually became a pernicious, contemptible sect. The new church did not seek to eradicate Judaism—it wanted to preserve Judaism as an aged, humbled creature that had long since lost its admirers, and whose insignificant existence vindicated the victors. In these circumstances, the large number of Jews around the Mediterranean inevitably declined at an accelerating rate. Zionist historians, as we shall see in the next chapter, tend to suggest that those who left Judaism in times of isolation and stress were mainly the newly converted. The “ethnic” hard core of “birth Jews”—a term often found in Zionist historiography—kept the faith and remained unalterably Jewish. There is, of course, not a shred of evidence for this völkisch interpretation. It is equally likely that the numerous families that had taken to Judaism by choice, or even their descendants in the next few generations, would have clung to it more fervently than those born to it effortlessly. Converts and their offspring famously tend to be more devoted to their chosen religion than old believers.

In 324 CE the province of Palestine became a Christian protectorate, and a large part of its population became Christian. Jerusalem—home of the first Christian community, founded by local Judeans in the first century CE,107 and from which circumcised men were expelled after the Bar Kokhba revolt—gradually became a predominantly Christian city. The list of participants in the first Christian council, in Nicaea in 325 CE, reveals that there were also Christian communities in Gaza, Jabneh, Ashqelon, Ashdod, Lod (Lydda), Beit She’an, Shechem, Gadara and elsewhere. It appears that the disappearance of Jews from the country coincided with the conversion of many of them to Christianity.

Baer, Dinur and other Zionist historians were not mistaken in stating that this significant Jewish presence was drastically reduced following the Muslim conquest in the seventh century, but this was not due to the uprooting of Jews from the country, for which there is no shred of evidence in the historical record. Palestine, the former Judea, was not swept by masses of migrants from the Arabian Desert who dispossessed the indigenous inhabitants. The conquerors had no such policy, and neither exiled nor expelled the Judean agrarian population, whether they believed in Yahweh or in the Christian Trinity.

The seventh-century Armenian bishop Sebeos described the Arab conquest of Palestine as the descendants of Ishmael coming to the aid of the descendants of Isaac against the Byzantine Empire, in fulfillment of God’s promise to their common ancestor Abraham.110 A contemporary Jew wrote in a letter: God it was who inspired the Ishmaelite kingdom to aid us. When they spread forth and captured the Land of the Hind from the hand of Edom, and reached Jerusalem, there were Israelites among them. They showed them the place of the Temple, and have dwelled with them to this day. They made it a condition that they preserve the place of the Temple from any abomination, and would pray at its gates, and none would gainsay them.111

The new conquerors had an extraordinary system of taxation: Muslims did not have to pay any taxes; only the unbelievers did. Given the benefits of Islamization, it is not surprising that the new religion quickly attracted great numbers of converts. Exemption from taxation must have been seen as worth a change of deity, especially as he seemed so much like the former one. In fact, the caliphs’ taxation policy had to be modified later, as the mass conversion to Islam by the conquered populations threatened to drain their treasury.

The Arab uprising and the massacre in Hebron, which happened the year Ben-Zvi published his booklet, and subsequently the widespread Palestinian revolt of 1936–39, took the remaining wind out of the sails of the integrationist Zionist thinkers. The rise of a local nationalism made it very clear to the educated settlers that their ethnocentric bear-hug had no future. The inclusive concept briefly adopted by Zionists was based on the assumption that it would be easy to assimilate a “low and primitive” Oriental culture, and so the first violent resistance from the objects of this Orientalist fantasy shook them awake.

The time of the expulsion was unimportant—the main thing was the precious memory of a forced exile.

Had the memory of the mass conversion to Judaism been preserved, it might have eroded the metanarrative about the biological unity of the Jewish people, whose genealogical roots were believed to trace back all the way to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—not to a heterogeneous mosaic of human populations that lived in the Hasmonean kingdom, in the Persian domain and in the far-flung expanses of the Roman Empire.

Compared with the meticulous description of Himyar’s history, and the strict use of original sources at every stage of the work, this concluding paragraph seems out of place, even somewhat absurd. Yet it deserves to be quoted, because it demonstrates the nature and thinking of Zionist historiography on the subject of proselytizing. Hirschberg had not the slightest evidence concerning the number, if any, of “born Jews” in the different classes of Himyarite society, nor about the origins of those who clung to the Jewish faith. But the ethnocentric imperative was stronger than his historical training, and demanded that he conclude his work with the “call of the blood.” Otherwise, the readers of this respected scholar’s work might fall into the error of thinking that the Jews of the Yemen were descendants of Dhu Nuwas and his hardened nobles, and not of the peaceable Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the purported patriarchs of all the Jews in the world.

Polak’s great sin, according to some of the reviews, lay in the assumption that concluded his work.

[T]he large majority of surviving Jews in the world is of Eastern European—and thus perhaps mainly of Khazar—origin. If so, this would mean that their ancestors came not from the Jordan but from the Volga, not from Canaan but from the Caucasus, once believed to be the cradle of the Aryan race; and that genetically they are more closely related to the Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Should this turn out to be the case, then the term “anti-Semitism” would become void of meaning, based on a misapprehension shared by both the killers and their victims. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it slowly emerges from the past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax which history has ever perpetrated.114

While the secular, seminationalistic outlook of the Bund, the widespread leftist Jewish movement, demanded cultural autonomy for the “people of Yiddishland,” rather than a single independent polity for all the Jews of the world, educated Zionists emulated the other nationalists in Europe and assumed an ethnoreligious or ethnobiological identity to conceptualize their self-definition. Seeking to build a bridge that could connect Jewish believers—mainly former believers, whose languages and secular customs were polyphonous and diverse—they were unable to build on the lively popular mores and turn them into a homogeneous, domesticated modern culture, as the Bund tried to do. To achieve their aim, the Zionists needed to erase existing ethnographic textures, forget specific histories, and take a flying leap backward to an ancient, mythological and religious past.

Ruppin knew the “Orient” well. In 1908 he was appointed director of the Palestine Office of the central executive of the Zionist movement, with the specific task of buying land. He was the father of Jewish settlement, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that Ruppin was to Zionist colonization what Herzl was for the organized national movement. Although by 1948 only some 10 percent of the land of Palestine had been purchased, he could claim much of the credit for the agro-economic infrastructure on which Israel was established. He bought land all over the country, and also set up the central institutions that distributed it. He did much to ensure that the Zionist conquest of the soil would be totally separated from the Palestinian agricultural economy. The biological distinction had to be maintained by systematic “ethnic” separation. Ruppin’s practical activity did not entirely interrupt his theoretical work. In 1926 he was appointed lecturer in “the sociology of the Jews” at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem; thereafter, till his death in 1943, he continued to develop his demographic ideas about the Darwinist struggle of the “Jewish race.” Right up until the outbreak of the Second World War, he even maintained academic ties with the eugenicist thinkers who were thriving in Germany. Amazingly, the victory of Nazism did not entirely curtail these contacts. After Hitler’s rise to power, the Jerusalem lecturer traveled to Germany to visit Hans Günther, the “pope” of racial theory, who joined the Nazi party in 1932, was the architect of the extermination of the Gypsies, and remained a Holocaust denier to his dying day.18

It should be noted, however, that the Jewish blood theory was not held exclusively by the handful of leading thinkers quoted above. It was popular in all currents of the Zionist movement, and its imprint can be found in almost all its publications, congresses and conferences. Young intellectuals of the movement’s second rank copied and distributed it among the activists and supporters, and it became a kind of axiom that inspired dreams and imaginings of the ancient Jewish people.20

In 1950, a much-publicized declaration by a number of senior scientists, under the aegis of UNESCO, completely rejected any connection between biology and national cultures, stating that the concept of race was a social myth rather than a scientific fact, after which serious researchers avoided the term.33 But this general acceptance did not deter the workers in the life sciences in Israel, nor did it undermine the profound Zionist belief in the common origin of the wandering people. “The Jewish race” disappeared from the vocabulary of conventional research, but it was replaced by a scientific field with a respectable title: “the study of the origin of the Jewish communities.”

In November 2000 the Israeli daily Haaretz published an illuminating report about the research of Professor Ariela Oppenheim and her colleagues at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The actual findings were published that month in Human Genetics, a scientific periodical published by Springer Verlag in Germany.39 The reason for the media interest was the discovery made by the team of a remarkable closeness between certain mutations in the Y-chromosome of Jews, both “Ashkenazi” and “Sephardic,” and those of the “Israeli Arabs” and the Palestinians. The conclusion reached was that two-thirds of the Palestinians and roughly the same proportion of Jews shared three male ancestors eight thousand years ago. In actual fact, the expanded scientific paper showed a somewhat more complex, and much more confusing, picture: those mutations in the Y-chromosome also indicated that the “Jews” resembled the “Lebanese Arabs” more than the Czechs, but the “Ashkenazis,” as opposed to the “Sephardics,” were relatively closer to the “Welsh” than to the “Arabs.” The study had been written and edited during the period of the Oslo Accords, before the outbreak of the Second Intifada. Unfortunately, by the time it appeared in print the uprising had already broken out. The genetic data showing that Jews and Palestinians had some ancient ancestors in common did not cause the conflict to be described as an internecine war, but it did indirectly reinforce the assumption, which had struck root some time earlier, that the origin of all the Jews lay unquestionably in the Near East. The rigor of those investigating Jewish DNA in Israel was demonstrated by the sequel to the team’s biological adventure. A little over a year after the first important discovery, the inside pages of Haaretz carried a sensational new scoop. It transpired that the genetic resemblance between the Jews and the Palestinians, discovered by the previous research, did not exist. The scientists admitted that their earlier experiment had not been sufficiently grounded and detailed, and that its conclusions had been hasty. In fact, the Jews—or, at any rate, the male ones—were related not to the neighboring Palestinians but rather to the distant Kurds. The new paper, published first by the American Society of Human Genetics, showed that the sly Y-chromosome had fooled its inexperienced investigators.40 But never fear, the updated genetic picture still indicated that the Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews were related, only now they did not resemble the local Arabs, but rather the Armenians, Turks, and chiefly, as noted, the Kurds. Needless to say, it is not suggested that the raging intifada had indirectly advanced the science of genetics in Israel, yet from then on the blood brothers were once more apart and alien.

In 1947 the UN General Assembly resolved by a majority vote to establish a “Jewish state” and an “Arab state” in the territory that had previously been known as “Palestine/Eretz Israel.”49 At that time, many thousands of displaced Jewish persons were wandering in Europe, and the small community that had been created by the Zionist settlement enterprise was supposed to take them in. The United States, which before 1924 had taken in many of the Yiddish Jews, now refused to open its gates to the broken remnants of the great Nazi massacre. So did the other rich countries. In the end, it was easier for these countries to solve the troublesome Jewish problem by offering a faraway land that was not theirs.

As in such countries as Poland, Greece and Ireland before the Second World War, or even today’s Estonia and Sri Lanka, the Zionist identity contains a very distinctive blend of ethnocentric nationalism with traditional religion, where the religion becomes an instrument serving the leaders of the imaginary ethnos. Liah Greenfeld described these particular types of problematic nationalism as follows: … religion being no longer the expression of the revealed truth and inner personal conviction, but an outward sign and symbol of their collective distinctness … What is of greater moment is that, when valued chiefly for this external—and mundane—function, religion becomes an ethnic characteristic, an ascriptive, unalterable attribute of a collectivity, and, as such, a reflection of necessity, rather than personal responsibility and choice; that is to say, in the final analysis, a reflection of race.56

The nature of Jewish nationalism, enshrined in the laws of the state, was cast into sharp focus four years later. In 1962 Shmuel Oswald Rufeisen, known as “Brother Daniel,” petitioned the High Court of Justice (the Supreme Court) to instruct the state to recognize him as a Jew by nationality. Rufeisen was born to a Jewish family in Poland in 1922, and as a teenager joined a Zionist youth movement. He fought as a partisan against the Nazi occupation and saved the lives of many Jews. At some point he hid in a monastery, where he converted to Christianity. After the war he studied for the priesthood, and in order to go to Israel he became a Carmelite monk.62 In 1958 he went to Israel because he wished to take part in the Jewish destiny and still saw himself as a Zionist. Having given up his Polish citizenship, he applied to become an Israeli citizen on the basis of the Law of Return, arguing that although he was a Catholic by religion, he was still a Jew by “nationality.” When his application was rejected by the Ministry of the Interior, he petitioned the High Court of Justice. By a four-to-one decision, the court rejected his petition to be given Israeli citizenship on the basis of the Law of Return. He was, however, granted an Israeli identity card, which stated, “Nationality: Not clear.”63 Ultimately, Brother Daniel’s betrayal of Judaism by joining the religion of the Nazarene overcame the deterministic biological imaginary. It was categorically decided that there was no Jewish nationality without its religious shell. Ethnocentric Zionism needed the Halakhic precepts as its principal criteria, and the secular judges understood this national-historical necessity very well. Another effect that this decision had on the concept of identity in Israel was to deny the right of the individual to declare himself a Jew—now, only the sovereign judicial authority could determine the “nationality” of a citizen living in his own country.64

In 1970, under pressure from the religious camp, the Law of Return was amended to include, finally, a full and exact definition of who is an authentic member of the people of Israel: “A Jew is one who was born to a Jewish mother, or converted to Judaism and does not belong to another religion.” After twenty-two years of hesitation and questioning, the instrumental link between the rabbinical religion and the essentialist nationalism was now well and truly welded.

Just as the French were persuaded that their ancestors were the Gauls, and the Germans cherished the idea that they descended directly from the Aryan Teutons, so the Jews had to know that they were the authentic descendants of the “children of Israel” who came out of Egypt.

What happened to the population of Judea if it did not undergo exile? I have been accused of claiming that the Palestinians of today are its direct descendants. This is certainly not an idea that I came up with; in my book I cited the declarations of prominent Zionist leaders, including David Ben-Gurion, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Israel Belkind, who all believed that the “fellahs” they encountered in the early days of colonization were descended from the ancient Jewish people, and that the two populations had to be reunited. They knew perfectly well that there was no exile in the first century CE, and they logically concluded that the great mass of the Jews had converted to Islam with the arrival of Arab forces in the early seventh century. David Ben-Gurion later went on to express a totally different position, when he helped to draft the Declaration of Independence of the state of Israel, without ever explaining this reversal.

The Middle East today is probably the most dangerous region in the world for those who consider themselves Jews.

In Buenos Aires, Olive met a woman who wanted to show her a tattoo. “I hope this isn’t weird,” she said, and rolled up her sleeve to reveal a quote from the book: We knew it was coming, in a beautiful curly script on her left shoulder. Olive’s breath caught in her throat. It wasn’t just a line from Marienbad, it was a tattoo in Marienbad. In the second half of the novel, her character Gaspery-Jacques had the line tattooed on his left arm. You write a book with a fictional tattoo and then the tattoo becomes real in the world and after that almost anything seems possible. She’d seen five of those tattoos, but that didn’t make it less extraordinary, seeing the way fiction can bleed into the world and leave a mark on someone’s skin. “That’s incredible,” Olive said softly. “It’s incredible to see that tattoo in the real world.” “It’s my favorite line from your book,” she said. “It’s just true of so much, isn’t it?”

Income inequality within the US has grown since the 1970s, but the major disparity in working-class wealth is between the rich and poor countries. The claim that working-class membership in trade unions is declining reveals this relative prosperity, and not simply a corollary of the rise of corporate influence.

This 250-year progression of capitalist development was both asymmetrical and uneven, but undeniably it profoundly reshaped economic change on a world scale. A distinctive factor in this development is that metropolitan and most settler-colonial states saw the emergence and expansion of capitalism that in a relatively short period satisfied basic human needs and provided social services and ubiquitous access to consumer goods and new technology. In contrast, by all historical accounts, most of the world’s population experienced a dramatic decline in their standard of living as Western capitalism was imposed on the enduring social formations rooted in agrarian regions of the planet. In the twenty-first century, the world’s working class is in its most dramatic stage of transformation since the origins of capitalism in the 1750s.

Free market economics and privatization dominated by neoliberal free market governance came to a close in the second decade of the twenty-first century, in the aftermath of the 2008 Great Financial Recession. This system is characterized by the ascendency of free markets and the withdrawal of state controls and support for workers. Implemented on an international basis, labour and working-class parties and organizations have been unable to reverse or even control this trend. As a consequence, governments shifted to neoliberal policies which abandoned wage and social protections to workers from global and national markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, welfare states were replaced by free market policies benefiting investors who exploited the systematic privatization of national resources, industry, infrastructure, and investment. The concentration of wealth and intensification of economic divisions could not have been possible without the erosion and disappearance of political representation for workers, the poor, and peasants.

While People Power was technically a revolutionary movement, by calling on the International Monetary Fund to cancel foreign debt Aquino and her successors did not challenge international financial institutions, and remained under the economic, political, and military domination of the USA. Less than a year after the People Power Revolution, on 22 January 1987, Philippines state security forces fired on 20,000 farmers protesting for land reform on Mendiola Street outside the president’s Malacañang Palace residence. In the massacre, riot police fired on unarmed peasant protesters, killing 19 and injuring about 100 others. As Timberman notes: ‘To some, the Mendiola massacre was bloody proof that the Aquino government was just as brutal and reactionary as its predecessor.’7 The NDF, for example, used the incident to justify the abandonment of peace talks with the government. The Mendiola massacre marked the end of any pretext that the government, oligarchs, and multinational capital would tolerate social transformation in the Philippines, and regenerated popular movements in the rural regions for authentic redistribution to landless peasants.

In the subsequent half-century of US colonial rule, a violent military offensive was waged against the indigenous people of Mindanao. These constituted a majority of the island’s population, especially the Lumads and Moros. Their lands were nearly entirely confiscated by the violent expropriation and resettlement of impoverished migrants from Luzon and the Visayas, who became a landless peasantry in an exploitative feudal system. While much of the indigenous population was defeated in US military campaigns and their land expropriated and turned over to commercial interests, landless migrants from Luzon and the Visayas were forced to work on plantations for their very survival.

In the ensuing years 2002–2006, workers at other packing plants joined KMU-affiliated unions throughout the Compostela Valley. The KMU represented workers in grievances over underpayment of wages, violations of labour standards, management harassment, and intimidation from politicians and the military. According to two fact-finding missions in 2006, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) directly intervened in union affairs and sought to suppress the exposure of the violations of labour rights and the cooperative scheme developed by Stanfilco which violated the rights of packing plant workers through the subcontracting scheme. Subsequently, government authorities had consistently sought to establish phoney unions that opposed increasing wages for workers. Frequently, the KMU and its affiliates were red-baited as communist labour organizations to instil fear in workers who feared police and military targeting.49 That same year, Stanfilco was sold to the Japanese multinational Sumitomo Fruit (Philippines) Corporation and AJMR Holdings Company, which became known as Sumifru.

By 2012, in the wake of the Marikana Massacre of platinum miners by South African State Police, it was clear that the Tripartite Alliance of the African National Congress (ANC), South African Communist Party (SACP), and the Confederation of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) would not push for social transformation, but defiantly protect the dominant capitalist neoliberal order. Marikana defined the limits of the post-apartheid state and its commitment to capitalist development rather than labour law, and its commitment to pursue neoliberal policies to sustain informalization of the labour market. In league with international capital and consulting agencies, subcontracting informal and temporary labour would be advanced through support of the labour brokerage and temporary employment services, representing a refutation of the principles of multiracial equality.

COSATU and its affiliate unions generated massive wealth for trade union leaders in these key sectors, and lost the vibrant militancy it had earned in the apartheid era. Cyril Ramaphosa, president of South Africa, was formerly the general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers. He left to become a member of the board of trustees of the foreign-dominated mining conglomerate Lonmin, and presided over the Marikana Massacre on 16 August 2012.51 Thus, the stagnation of economic growth and the growing inequality and lack of opportunity created an image of a disengaged black South African leadership. Unlike ostensibly developing states, South Africa primarily transformed into an extractive society directed at profiting its dominant white capitalists and those blacks who were part of the governing leadership.

Though living standards of the working class in the global North have declined over the last 25 years, they are incomparably better off than those of far more workers in the global South, where income does not provide for the basic necessities. Over the same period, as Third World workers are increasingly drawn into the capitalist economy, workers have faced systemic oppression, poverty, and precarity. As sociologist Jan Breman and historian Marcel van der Linden write: The real norm or standard in global capitalism is insecurity, informality or precariousness, and the Standard Employment Relationship is an historical phenomenon which had a deep impact in a limited part of the world for a relatively short period of time. If, as we argue, the ‘Rest’ is not now becoming like the ‘West’, but the other way round, then the ‘traditional’ forms of collective action that have developed in the North Atlantic region during the last two centuries are gradually losing much of their impact. New forms of collective action are emerging, though these are often still at an embryonic stage. It is, therefore, high time to rethink the concept of the working class and the ways in which it can further its interests.1

The monetarists’ idea that creating more money typically leads to inflation comes from the distant past. Milton Friedman, a leading monetarist and one of the architects of the turn to free market capitalism in the 1970s and ’80s, argued that ‘inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon’. He meant that if inflation was occuring, it could always be explained by changes in the amount of money in the economy.

What is happening, then, is a deliberate effort to create a political and economic environment that will frighten workers into accepting wage cuts.

The Bank of England’s bloodcurdling forecasts of prolonged recession and unemployment contribute to the same message. As the Financial Times put it, the Bank of England ‘wants us to feel poorer, spend less and be more fearful about demanding pay increases’.1 And, of course, the Tory Treasury, insisting that public sector workers cannot have inflation-matching pay rises, pushes in the same direction.

If it works, it might eventually have some impact on inflation, but profits would certainly be protected. It is more likely, however, that the policy will fail, and we will end up with a recession together with inflation that is still high – a deadly combination that economists call ‘stagflation’. The reason is simple. Cutting the real wages of teachers or call-centre workers or delivery riders in Britain does not, for instance, make the gas we import from Qatar any cheaper. Not a single extra silicon chip will be produced by refusing to pay nurses properly. Similar arguments apply to raising interest rates. There is no interest rate in London so high that it will end the war in Ukraine. The cause of the present inflation is not workers’ wages, or pensions, or benefits.

What are the roots of contemporary financialisation? And, in turn, what tensions does it generate? In a ‘Regulation School’ perspective, a system pulled along by finance can be described as a set of mechanisms capable of temporarily containing the dissonances of accumulation. In their own very different or even radically opposed ways, Post-Keynesian and Hayekian approaches each point to a capitalist dynamic tormented and destabilised by inappropriate regulatory, budgetary and monetary policies. For its part, the Marxist point of view privileges the contradictions and conflicts that undermine – and at the same time drive – a mode of production through its historical developments. From this perspective, the eruption of finance is nothing other than a manifestation of capitalism running out of breath, as evidenced by the succession of increasingly violent financial crises since the early 1980s. These different points of view will inform our own rather pessimistic argument. The contemporary accumulation of fictitious capital is already caked with the frosts of winter. For a time, the increasing sophistication of finance allowed a certain concealment of the growing disconnect between, on the one hand, the exhaustion of the productive dynamic, and, on the other, the needs of capital and popular aspirations. The 2007–8 crisis stripped away the veil: austerity policies, structural reforms and the priority given to financial stabilisation seek to ensure that it is capital’s needs and not the people’s that prevail. Such is the basis for today’s great social regression.

The hypothesis associating financialisation with decline is not a self-evident one. Braudel himself referred to the success of financial capitalism in Europe between 1830 and 1860, ‘when the banks took hold of everything, of industry and then the commodity, and the economy in general became strong enough finally to support this structure’.7 According to Rudolf Hilferding, finance capital was at the heart of the lightning growth of German industrial capitalism at the turn of the twentieth century. For his part, Alexander Gerschenkron, the great theorist of ‘catching up’, explained that finance was a weapon in the arsenal of institutional tricks allowing a drive toward accelerated industrialisation, directly reaching large-scale production.8 Financialisation was thus also the springtime of industrial capitalism. So, if today it marks the sign of autumn, we have to explain why that is the case. What are the roots of contemporary financialisation? And, in turn, what tensions does it generate? In a ‘Regulation School’ perspective, a system pulled along by finance can be described as a set of mechanisms capable of temporarily containing the dissonances of accumulation.

Conversely, however, there was indeed front running in a wider sense. Since the futures market was at the time an open-outcry market, traders could interpret the noise, body language and hand signals of the agent in charge of LTCM’s operations and thus place orders for their own accounts before the LTCM orders were given. This informational advantage is expressed in the data showing an abnormal level of transactions in the one to two minutes preceding the transactions linked to LTCM, which contributed to aggravating the fund’s losses. Cai’s study challenges the hypothesis that the agents who make the financial markets work at a micro-level do not have informational advantages. In fact, this type of asymmetry is found even in the most open public markets.

Conscious that ‘poor little subprime borrowers won’t last long’, he nonetheless sold bonds ‘to widows and orphans’. Ironically, however, he stated that he was not ‘feeling too guilty about this’ – after all, ‘the real purpose of [the] job is to make capital markets more efficient and ultimately provide the US consumer with more efficient ways to leverage and finance himself’.13 In a few lines, Tourre bluntly demonstrated the main virtue of the financial market efficiency hypothesis – namely, that it serves to justify the operations that bring colossal incomes to those who master the markets. The Abacus case moreover demonstrated that the role of the big investment banks and hedge funds is certainly not limited to correcting market distortions: it also consists of creating these distortions, in such a manner as to organise transfers of wealth. Despite the great pregnancy of the discourse on market efficiency, we arrive at what is altogether a rather prosaic conclusion: the institutions establishing themselves at the centre of the world’s financial system use and abuse their position and the exclusive information available to them in order to make money.

In the second case, after an Asian client filed a suit against Morgan Stanley, certain details came to light regarding what Wall Street knew about subprimes.21 In 2005 Morgan Stanley managers became aware that something had gone wrong: one employee, mentioning the case of a borrower who claimed to be earning $12,000 a month as the ‘operation manager [sic]’ of a tarot-reading house, concluded that the loans that his company was being given to turn into securities were senseless. By early 2006, the bank had made up its mind on the real-estate market, deciding to speculate on a fall in the very securities it was offloading onto its own clients. By 2007, it was in the mood for joking: when its team sought a name for a subprime derivative being sold as ‘safer than triple A’, the ideas they came up with included ‘Mike Tyson’s Punchout’, ‘Nuclear Holocaust’, ‘Hitman’, ‘Subprime Meltdown’ or, more plainly, ‘Sack of Shit’.

Studies by economists played a legitimating role in each phase of the liberalisation of finance. This close connection was not without its ethical problems, since the economists in question often had a direct interest in promoting liberalisation. Such is the lesson of Charles Ferguson’s film Inside Job, which notes for example that Larry Summers – former Harvard president but also a former Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration and an adviser to President Obama – untiringly defended financial liberalisation throughout the 2000s, a period in which his ties with the finance industry brought him more than $20 million.

Studies by economists played a legitimating role in each phase of the liberalisation of finance. This close connection was not without its ethical problems, since the economists in question often had a direct interest in promoting liberalisation. Such is the lesson of Charles Ferguson’s film Inside Job, which notes for example that Larry Summers – former Harvard president but also a former Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration and an adviser to President Obama – untiringly defended financial liberalisation throughout the 2000s, a period in which his ties with the finance industry brought him more than $20 million. In the wake of the financial crisis, a study of nineteen eminent financial economics specialists showed that, in addition to their university posts, most of them had affiliations with the private sector which they never publicly disclosed.36 In France, too, a number of studies have added to the dossier on ‘economists for hire’.37 But again here, although there is indeed a conflict of interests, this is not the essential point.

The financial instability hypothesis allows us to inscribe these speculation dynamics in an understanding of economic cycles. Minsky sets out from the recognition that capitalist economies experience periods of acceleration and inflation and periods in which they are caught in deflationary spirals in which debts become unsustainable. The 1960s and 1970s corresponded to the first dynamic and the 1930s (paradigmatically so) to the second, as described by the economist Irving Fischer in 1933. The latter dynamic comes about when economic agents trying to meet the deadlines on their debt repayments are forced to sell what they have at discounted prices. This brings a general downward movement in prices and diminished revenues, and ultimately leads to a growth in the weight of debt relative to income. This in turn unleashes a self-sustaining movement toward depression, which only state intervention can interrupt.

Finance’s tendency toward increased sophistication leads to three possible systems of relations between income and debts. The first corresponds to a situation in which economic actors’ incomes cover their repayment obligations: thus, financial relations are solid and pose no problems to the overall reproduction of the economy. The second possibility is the establishment of speculative relations in which some economic units keep their debt rolling (they can only repay the interest, but not the principal). Such a configuration produces vulnerability, and the slightest conjunctural difficulty risks tipping the situation into the third possibility: the development of Ponzi structures, where income flows are insufficient to repay either the principal or the interest on the debt. The consequence is that indebtedness can only increase, ultimately leading to bankruptcies. The stability of economies is largely dependent on the respective weights of these three types of financing relations. Minsky enjoys a certain posthumous renown because he emphasised that across periods of prolonged prosperity, economies gradually evolve toward a financing structure that makes the system unstable.

The development of the finance markets since the 1970s thus results from the mutual reinforcement of two dynamics: on the one hand, the confidence placed in the self-regulation of the financial sector has opened the floodgates to financial innovation; on the other hand, the experiences of the 1980s debt crisis in the countries of the global South, the 1987 market crash in the US, the 1994 Mexican crisis, the Asian and Russian crises of 1998 and the 2001 crisis in the new economies have fed the sentiment that the authorities will be able to contain catastrophes. The actions of Alan Greenspan, FED president from 1987 to 2007, did much to give credence to this belief. The measures taken to save LTCM in 1998, and then the heavy interest rate cuts following the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2001, comforted market actors in their conviction that the FED would always intervene to contain their losses. This idea has also been associated with the concept of a ‘Greenspan put’. The notion of the ‘put’ – borrowed from the vocabulary of option contracts – emphasises an implicit central bank support for financial values, equivalent to a ‘put’ option: that is, a guarantee that the price of financial assets cannot fall beneath a certain level. Indeed, in reducing interest rates, the FED supported asset prices: with lower interest rates, investors could take on more debt, at less cost, and invest in the stock markets. Moreover, returns on financial securities became more advantageous relative to the interest rate.

Profits upon alienation grow in tandem with rising household indebtedness, whether it is used to finance housing, study, the purchase of durable goods like cars, or goods for immediate consumption. Consumer credit is one of this trend’s most strikingly visible practices, with specialised companies working at usurious rates; as of April 2014, the effective annual interest rate applied by the leading French consumer credit company Cofinoga stood at 19 per cent, as against the ECB refinancing rate of 0.25 per cent. Another aspect of this phenomenon is households becoming over-indebted, with their incomes no longer sufficing to honour the payments they owe to their creditors. This phenomenon has grown considerably, including because of rising unemployment. In France, the number of insolvency cases recorded by the Banque de France commission in charge of addressing this problem rose from 60,000 at the beginning of the 1990s to 150,000 in 2007, before continuing past 200,000 in 2012.

Deductions from company profits are based on the repartition of the surplus-value extracted from production activities, which is divided between productive capital and financial capital. Capital gains are partly based on a zero-sum game between participants on the financial markets and the providers of disposable money-capital. Founder’s profit also corresponds to a game that plays out internally to capital. The offering of a company on the stock market allows its creators – as well as the banks organising this operation – to pocket profits corresponding to the gap between the price of the firm’s assets and its market valorisation based on the capitalisation of its future profits. Profits upon alienation result from a radically different logic, indeed one that recalls pre-capitalist forms of revenue associated with debt. They represent a direct drain on individuals’ incomes, regardless of any kind of control over the production process itself. The final category corresponds to what I would propose we call political profits. These profits result from a flow of revenue toward finance, mediated by public institutions. These political profits themselves break down into two sub-categories. They result from both the interest on government bonds and the flows of interest payments stemming from financial stability policies

As Lapavitsas emphasises, finance ‘acts as the nerves and brains of the capitalist economy; it is the social entity that turns the marshalling of spare resources by society into an integral whole’.21 Finance is thus fundamentally ambivalent. This is what Figure 22 demonstrates. It is split between the predatory logic inherent in its incapacity to generate value by itself and, on the other hand, its role in organising capital accumulation, which favours innovation. It stands at a more abstract level than the developments that preceded it, for it is no longer based on particular incarnations of the different types of financial income flows, but aims directly to model the socio-economic dynamics which are at their origin.

Ultimately, the near-guaranteed returns shareholders enjoy in the context of deep and liquid financial markets – as compared to the specific investment made by workers and sub-contractors – imply that they are no more exposed to risks a priori than other stakeholders are. Quite the contrary. So there is no basis for considering shareholders better incentivised to control the way in which managers deploy the resources available to the firm. The idea that the strengthening of their power should increase efficiency is thus wholly unfounded.

Walmart is the paragon example of a global buyer in a globalised economy. The firm is both the world’s largest company – with a consolidated revenue of $476bn in 2013 – and the world’s largest private employer, with 2.2 million employees. It is also an extremely profitable company: since 2010, the Return on Equity of its own capital has never been less than 20 per cent. Each week, 200 million consumers visit its 10,000 sales points, established in twenty-seven countries. With its fleet of thousands of lorries and tens of thousands of trailers, its hundreds of distribution centres and own satellite system, it enjoys considerable logistical might. For example, it was able to reopen its stores the day after Hurricane Katrina, even before the federal emergency response agency had been able to deploy its rescue operations. Moreover, Walmart is a major actor in the international economy, importing some 15 per cent of the total consumer goods transported from China to the United States.34 Given Walmart’s economic power, we can easily understand why the balance of forces is little-favourable to most of its 60,000 suppliers. The retailer keeps them in a permanent state of competition, for it can easily switch its supply networks between different companies or even from one country to another. Thus, in order to maintain this often vitally important market, its suppliers will in turn work to reduce their own costs, particularly by resorting to sub-contractors operating on the margins of the globalised economy. The returns obtained by shareholders are thus manifestly connected to the shameless exploitation of labour at the other end of these chains,35 in particular in the export processing zones which have proliferated across the global South. In 2006, some 66 million people – most of them young women – worked in these areas, where taxes, regulations, and labour rights are almost non-existent.36 One such EPZ in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka was the site of the Rana Plaza tragedy. On 24 April 2013, 1,138 workers – most of them women – lost their lives in the collapse of an eight-storey block housing a number of textile workshops. The labels of brands such as Camaïeu, Walmart, H&M, Mango, Auchan, Carrefour and Benetton lay scattered among the debris. On the eve of the tragedy, inspectors had demanded the evacuation of the building after cracks appeared in the walls, but the textile workshop bosses insisted that work resume. The workers were paid less than one euro per day.

Let us summarise: the financialisation of non-financial firms seems partly to be an optical illusion. Certainly, the interest rate hikes of the early 1980s and the acceptance of the ideology of creating value for shareholders contributed to establishing a new profitability norm higher than in the preceding period. Yet this has not meant finance playing more of a predatory role, in the sense of financial payments acting as more of a drain on firms’ revenues than they previously did. While financial payments have increased considerably as a proportion of profits, this is also true of financial revenues. Over the long run, this has meant that non-financial firms’ net financial payments have not increased as a proportion of their profits. In other words, firms seem to pay more financial revenues to their creditors and shareholders thanks to the financial revenues that they themselves generate.

The power that fictitious capital has acquired is embodied in the liquidity of the financial markets. Securities represent a pre-emption on future production, but they also offer their owners the possibility of converting them into real money at any given moment. Collectively speaking, this liquidity is just an illusion, for it would be impossible immediately to liquidate all of these promises. But it is certainly a powerful fiction. Since 2008, the absolute priority that the public authorities have given to financial stability has expressed their determination to validate fictitious capital’s claim to liquidity. Yet this claim only holds true if the commitments that have already been made are respected. To put it another way: present financial profits sustain the value of accumulated fictitious capital; the promises made today can only be accepted if past ones have been kept. The great mission of governments and monetary authorities faced with each financial upheaval since the 1980s – and all the more so in recent years – has been to guarantee this continuity of financial profits.

There’s one other thing I remember very well about Dr. Tokai. I can’t recall how we got on to the topic, but he was chatting to me about women in general. Women are all born with a special, independent organ that allows them to lie. This was Dr. Tokai’s personal opinion. It depends on the person, he said, about the kind of lies they tell, what situation they tell them in, and how the lies are told. But at a certain point in their lives, all women tell lies, and they lie about important things. They lie about unimportant things, too, but they also don’t hesitate to lie about the most important things. And when they do, most women’s expressions and voices don’t change at all, since it’s not them lying, but this independent organ they’re equipped with that’s acting on its own. That’s why—except in a few special cases—they can still have a clear conscience and never lose sleep over anything they say.

Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.

Rape is so common in our culture it’s fair to call it an epidemic. After all, what else could you call something that impacts nearly one in five women (and one in seventy-one men) directly and, as a threat, virtually all women, that is so pervasive it modifies how we live and think and move through the world for most of our lives? Actual instances in which women have untruthfully claimed a rape occurred simply to malign some guy are extremely uncommon. The most reliable studies suggest that about 2 percent of rape reports are false, which means that 98 percent are real. Even that statistic doesn’t mean that 2 percent are false rape accusations, because saying you were raped if you weren’t isn’t the same thing as claiming a specific person raped you when he didn’t. (No one sifts for the category of false rape accusation of an individual, by the way.) Still, those stats don’t stop men from bringing the subject up again and again and again. And again.

Works of art that can accompany you through the decades are mirrors in which you can see yourself, wells in which you can keep dipping. They remind you that it’s as much what you bring to the work of art as what it brings to you that matters, and they become registers of how you’ve changed.

Whilst the petty bourgeoisie wanted change, Marx argued that they would never see the need for class struggle and the overthrow of capitalism because they believe themselves to be “the people”: neither the lazy aristocrats or the troublesome workers. In other words, they believed they were above class antagonisms, and relatedly did not recognise that the state was the representative of ruling-class interests but rather something that was simply there to help society maintain order.

Russia’s industrial underdevelopment meant that the proletariat were not a majority there. For this reason, class alliances under the leadership of the revolutionary proletariat were a central pillar of Bolshevik strategy, and hence Lenin paid incredibly close attention to the class composition of Russia and the specificity of the other subaltern classes: the peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie.

Thatcherism as an ideology had a negative component that mobilized people against an enemy Other. Most famously, this was based around a “Churchillian” British nationalism that whipped up hatred of foreigners, but it also honed in on an enemy within — the lazy and idle, the shirkers and parasites. Crucially, this Other could be both those on welfare (and Thatcher genuinely did hate the working class) and state bureaucrats and professionals, therefore appealing to the petty bourgeoisie’s dislike of the working class below them and the professional managerial class above them.

But Thatcherism also had a positive component — a narrative of aspiration and social mobility, the defence of small property, traditionalism, free enterprise, family and entrepreneurialism, all of which appealed instinctively to petty bourgeois sensibilities. She also appealed to the petty bourgeoisie through concrete material concessions. Most obviously, this was the right-to-buy policy, which, as Chapter 5 shows, split the working class and created huge numbers of working-class Tories. But she also devoted a huge amount of effort to wooing and promoting small businesses (Chapter 2) and creating a culture of “enterprise” and “entrepreneurialism”. Through these strategies, she ensured that the Conservatives, the party of big business, were able to bind to the ruling bloc the section of society that historically had been most hostile to big capital.

Marx emphatically did not posit a dualist class structure polarized neatly between a working class and the bourgeoisie.

Neoliberalism has inverted many things. The class structure has changed from one that was relatively simple, with a large working class, small middle and small ruling class; to one that is far more complex, with a bloated intermediate class and a more heterogeneous ruling class. The best way to understand the middle is as split into two. The “upper” professionals may be classed as the professional-managerial classes, while the “lower” — which is frequently degraded and proletarianized — may be classed as the new petty bourgeoisie. The lower section is far larger than the upper.

Hobsbawm argues that the expansion of education was a conscious hegemonic strategy on the part of the ruling classes. Within a society riven by glaring divisions, the elites came to recognize the value of education in creating social stability, creating a loyal buffer class between them and the proletariat. The expansion of education was therefore specifically designed to co-opt the aspirational middle classes and keep them onside by providing an attractive hierarchy and “social stairway” to the upper orders. Of course, the ladder could rarely be climbed, and certain positions then rarely held, but what mattered was that the middle classes had to think that it could be.

Mental labour represents an unspoken, social and ideological dividing line in society, based on the legitimacy and superiority of certain types of knowledge. This dividing line is the “concrete manifestation of the political and ideological elements in the structural determination of class”. This is a widely understood but unspoken and intangible line in society between the working class (“them”) and everyone else (“us”), which plays a key role in a class-divided society. Poulantzas makes it clear that mental labour is what workers do not have. It is being on the side of “mental labour” that fundamentally splits off the new petty bourgeoisie from the working class. The new petty bourgeoisie, regardless of how little they earn or however much they become proletarianized, are always on the other side of the mental labour dividing line “with respect to the working class”. To the new petty bourgeoisie, the working class are “them”, and this is mutually understood.

The second way that capitalism is reproduced is informal — through the social relations, norms and values of school and education that exist beyond the formal curriculum. Success in school of course involves technical qualifications — doing the right GCSEs, staying on for A-Level and going to university — but on the whole, children are taught that their success and their social mobility is not simply predicted on technical expertise and formal qualifications, but instead on the possession of things inculcated in the “hidden curriculum” — the nebulous “competencies”, qualities and values that they must cultivate for the roles that they wish to take up. Thus, more important than GCSEs or A-Levels is learning the rules of how to succeed in the white-collar world: not just how to pass exams but the importance of exams themselves, the value of hard work and delayed gratification, working to deadlines, completing tasks on your own in isolation. Formal credentials and qualifications — whether it is your degree or A-Levels — of course often have no bearing at all on whether you can do the job. Instead, achieving these targets are more important for what they say about your loyalty and adherence to a set of values, which dovetail with the capitalist system.

Social mobility — the ideology that keeps the middle classes onside — is undoubtedly, and by now quantifiably, a lie — indeed, the great lie of our time. While social mobility saw an absolute increase within the UK for people born between the Fifties and late Seventies (ironically probably helped by the grammar school system), it has objectively declined since then and downward mobility has increased. You are now more likely than ever to stay in the same class you were born in. There are not enough “knowledge economy” jobs for everyone, the white-collar world has been massively deskilled and the massification of higher education has seen a huge devaluation of degrees, as predicted by C. Wright Mills back in the 1950s.

As Mills noted, by basing their prestige and status solely on educational qualifications and skills that are rapidly devalued and largely irrelevant in the world of work beyond school, they “open themselves to a precarious psychological life” that is redolent of old petty bourgeoisie’s permanent state of anxiety. For the declassed graduate, “among those who are not allowed to use the educated skills they have acquired, boredom increases, hope for success collapses into disappointment, and the sacrifices that don’t pay off lead to disillusionment”.

Harold Carter notes that, as landlordism was disincentivised by rent control and land nationalization, former privately rented housing stock was sold by landlords on a huge scale to working-class owner-occupiers. Indeed, the sales of these former rented homes — three million of them — were double the eventual sales of council houses under right-to-buy.

Thus, just as socialized housing was an ideological and social pillar of the Keynesian consensus, the privatization of housing is a central pillar of neoliberalism because it facilitates the gutting of the welfare state — once you privatize housing and shelter, you can privatize anything. However, just as housing was the “shaky pillar” of the welfare state, it is also the shaky pillar of neoliberalism. Owner-occupation is arguably the only lasting material concession made to the lower classes by neoliberalism, and high house prices that prevent downward social mobility are perhaps the only thing binding working class and petty bourgeois homeowners into the ruling bloc and stabilizing the system. The ruling class realize how unstable this coalition is, which is why so much effort is expended in artificially keeping prices high. If this fragile thread ever breaks, then huge swathes of the petty bourgeoisie would become instantly detached and society would be thrown into chaos.

The new petty bourgeoisie, just like the traditional petty bourgeoisie, undoubtedly experience genuine anger and, like the proletariat, are exploited. Yet this ideology and anger is refracted through the new petty bourgeoisie’s experiences and values — primarily, its individualism, isolated work environment and pre-existing beliefs in social mobility. As Poulantzas puts it, “even when the new petty bourgeois adopt working-class positions, they invest them with their own petty-bourgeois ideological (and cultural and social) practices”. Bechhofer and Elliot brand this specifically petty-bourgeois politics as “instrumental collectivism”: temporarily relying on the collective to facilitate individual advancement, which is a fundamentally different political motivation from the solidaristic collectivism of the working class. Whenever the petty bourgeoisie has engaged with progressive movements throughout history, this has been its view.

You may be one of the four million graduates in the UK who are stuck in non-graduate roles. You were ripped away from your community and mates, your parents are very proud of you and so you are desperate to do well; your parents spent a fortune on your education so you don’t have to do the same job your old man did. So, unlike the posh kids you met in university who messed around for three years, you worked your bollocks off to get a 2:1 or a first, only to find that you can’t get a graduate job or the job you wanted — either you’re not confident enough, relaxed enough or you don’t know the right people — and you gradually realise that all the skills you cultivated, all the sacrifices you made, all the qualities that you were praised for in school, all the debts you took on actually mean very little in the real world. So you’re faced with a choice: either continue to rent in a shithole in the big city and work as a barista, or go back to your small town and do the same thing you were doing before you left school, all while living in your old bedroom, managed by people who you are more qualified than. All the original advantages you had over your friends who didn’t go to university were for nothing. You are now in debt and you also don’t feel like you fit in properly anywhere. Undoubtedly, many precarious graduates see themselves — as I did — as the vanguard of the working class. And it is now the proletarianized degree-holders — rather than the working class — who are more likely to be in unions, to be leading strikes, picketing, etc., across the service economy. It is perfectly natural in these circumstances to feel defensive or precious about your own class. But it is important to realise that classifying people is not a moral judgement, and being part of the petty bourgeoisie is not a moral failing — a belief that it is culturally specific to the UK.

The fundamental difference between the graduate call centre worker and the non-graduate call centre worker is that the proletarianized graduate did not expect to be in a low-paid, deskilled job. They had different horizons and fundamentally different views of the world and their own place in it. It is unlikely that the proletarian colleague with no degree has a LinkedIn profile, for example, or is continually applying for other jobs. While they are sharing the same experience now, their experiences and ideology are not the same as the static life experience of the working class. They are being radicalised precisely because they are unhappy about being close to the proletariat, who they are different to and better than. This is implicit in all new petty-bourgeois moaning — I should not be working in a dead-end job with the thick kids from school; this job is not for me, but it is for them. This is a different, limited and individualized form of political radicalization (and one which does not require a total overhaul of the capitalist system) than that which has historically motivated working-class collectivist politics. Moreover, these goals and expectations also profoundly influence how and in what form this element of the new petty bourgeoisie gets involved in politics, the policies they focus on and, when they do get involved, how they behave and what they expect.

Breaking with these forms must involve the realization that social liberalism and identity politics have a class origin and clear class character. As Walter Benn Michaels, Adolph Reed Jr., Catherine Liu and others have repeatedly pointed out, they are rooted in and animated by the ideology and interests of the professional-managerial classes. As a cadence and set of behavioural norms, it is rooted in the need for aspirational members of the professional-managerial class to gain a competitive advantage in the liberal-professional fields both by building an identity (the pure, righteous individual), and being able to simultaneously discipline or marginalize anyone who might be a threat to your social mobility. It is a new and brilliant weapon for those competitive fields of society where everyone must climb over one another to succeed. Sadly, the reason it has emerged on the left is precisely because the left has been so deeply influenced by the professional-managerial classes, and because “left politics” has become another field in which aspirational people compete for status and upward mobility.

To achieve it, “politics” must be moved away from parliamentarism and back to workplaces and communities, so workers themselves can lead it rather than professional politicians and leftist celebrities. It therefore has to involve a break with Labourism and electoralism.

Finally, I have spent most of my adult life and career “on the left” around the new petty bourgeoisie. As I hope I have shown, the aspirations and ideology of this class are not so different from the old petty bourgeoisie at all. What would now be most transformative for the new petty bourgeoise — not just politically but psychologically — would be to abandon social mobility, to dispense with its obsessive focus on climbing the career ladder, to embrace and accept downward social mobility, to realise one can have an identity and meaning without a “career”, and that there is nothing wrong with staying rooted and not leaving your small town. This would lead to the gradual erosion of class boundaries between the subordinate classes and help guarantee the formation of broad political alliances, as well as making people a lot happier personally.

On the part of so-called Leninists, it is repeated that the ‘withering away of the state’ does not signify its end, its term, but indicates what would follow the creation of a classless society which, in its turn, cannot be constructed other than by maximum reinforcement of the state (and the class struggle) in the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is what Stalin wrote in Problems of Leninism: ‘Some comrades interpreted the thesis on … the withering away of the state to mean … a justification of the counterrevolutionary theory that the class struggle is subsiding and that state power is to be relaxed … The state will wither way, not as a result of a relaxation of the state power, but as a result of its utmost consolidation.’

Engels expresses himself most cautiously, saying that the proletarian state would ‘hardly’ permit the use of houses without payment, ‘at least during a transitional period’. The letting of houses owned by the whole people to individual families presupposes the collection of rent, a certain amount of control, and the employment of some standard in allotting the housing. All this calls for a certain form of state, but it does not at all call for a special military bureaucratic apparatus, with officials occupying especially privileged positions. The transition to a situation in which it will be possible to supply dwellings rent-free depends on the complete ‘withering away’ of the state.

Engels suggested to Bebel that all chatter about the state be dropped altogether, that the word ‘state’ be eliminated from the programme entirely and the word ‘community’ substituted for it. Engels even declared that the Commune was no longer a state in the proper sense of the word. Yet Marx even spoke of the ‘future state in communist society’, i.e. he would seem to recognize the need for the state even under communism.

Yet Marx even spoke of the ‘future state in communist society’, i.e. he would seem to recognize the need for the state even under communism. But such a view would be fundamentally wrong. A closer examination shows that Marx’s and Engels’s views on the state and its withering away were completely identical, and that Marx’s expression quoted above refers to the state in the process of withering away.

That is why we are entitled to speak only of the inevitable withering away of the state, emphasizing the protracted nature of this process and its dependence upon the rapidity of development of the higher phase of communism, and leaving the question of the time required for, or the concrete forms of, the withering away quite open, because there is no material for answering these questions.

Until the ‘higher’ phase of communism arrives, the socialists demand the strictest control by society and by the state over the measure of labour and the measure of consumption; but this control must start with the expropriation of the capitalists, with the establishment of workers’ control over the capitalists, and must be exercised not by a state of bureaucrats, but by a state of armed workers.

But the scientific distinction between socialism and communism is clear. What is usually called socialism was termed by Marx the ‘first’, or lower, phase of communist society. Insofar as the means of production becomes common property, the word ‘communism’ is also applicable here, providing we do not forget that this is not complete communism.

Kautsky has not understood at all the difference between bourgeois parliamentarism, which combines democracy (not for the people) with bureaucracy (against the people), and proletarian democracy, which will take immediate steps to cut bureaucracy down to the roots, and which will be able to carry these measures through to the end, to the complete abolition of bureaucracy, to the introduction of complete democracy for the people.

For the past few decades, to discuss the geography of incarceration in the United States was to talk about a sort of banishment to the rural hinterland. The prison boom that spanned the early 1970s to the 1990s saw people—particularly Black men —exiled from the nation’s biggest cities and sentenced to live in state and federal prisons in isolated and often-desperate places. As both the length and number of sentences increased, the story goes, newly minted prison towns embraced the rapid expansion of the prison-industrial complex as deliverance from economic decline.

As Naomi Murakawa argues in her examination of the racial construction of the methamphetamine epidemic, “when health problems are constructed as problems of individual behavior, as has been the case with obesity, tobacco, and drug abuse, then political accounts put a premium on criticizing individuals rather than larger determinants of health.”9 Given that incarceration is consistently associated with an increase in drug-related harm, including overdose death, this logic is particularly perverse.10 The jails built to “save” drug users from themselves contribute to their premature deaths.

For example, analysis of the Early County, Georgia, jail population showed that after motor-vehicle or traffic-related charges and drug charges, the third most prevalent charge bringing people to jail was against parents whose children were not enrolled in or were not attending school, a violation of Georgia’s mandatory education statute.12 Elsewhere, eugenicist judges have offered jail credits to people who agree to undergo vasectomies or submit to other forms of birth control.

California built twenty-three new prisons from 1982 to 2002, setting the world record for prison-building.3 This state-level prison-building spree occurred alongside significant divestment from social services, which opened pathways for surplus capital to invest in municipal bonds for prison construction.4 But as capital investment in building state prisons slowed, local cities and counties emerged as a new geography ripe for carceral expansion.

Even with the consent decree in place they continued to do that.

In the last twenty-five years, Central Appalachia has had one of the highest concentrations of rural prison and jail expansion in the United States.2 The proliferation of “cages in the coalfields” is closely linked to the decline of the coal industry and the rise of the opioid crisis.3 Coal mining has experienced a massive decline in the last two decades. Eastern Kentucky lost 73 percent of its coal jobs between 2011 and 2018.4 Concurrent with that decline has been the rise of the opioid epidemic. In the late 1990s, Purdue Pharma targeted Central Appalachia as an area with high levels of occupational pain from coal mining and commenced a juggernaut of misleading advertising and hard-press sales to doctors in the region, opening the gates to a profit-driven over-prescription of OxyContin and a devastating wave of addiction and death. Purdue Pharma’s flooding of the coalfields with OxyContin, and the subsequent carceral response in the region, created two decades of an acute social crisis rooted not only in the fallout from widespread generational addiction but also in the criminalization of addiction.

Kentucky has over 24,000 state prisoners, but only around 12,000 state prison beds. Rather than seek to reduce the state prison population through sentencing reform, decriminalization, and release, Kentucky has opted to house nearly half of state inmates in county jails. The incentives for counties work like this: the Kentucky Department of Corrections spends approximately sixty-seven dollars per day for each person it locks up in a state prison. But it can pay counties around thirty-two dollars per day to lock up state-sentenced people, usually convicted of what are called Class D or Class C felonies (often drug-related convictions) in local jails. Because most county jails spend around twenty-five dollars per day for each incarcerated or detained person, there is about a ten-dollar-per-day incentive to house state prisoners in county beds.8 These per diem payments add up, and they prop up local county budgets. They incentivize both jail crowding and the construction of bigger county jails, which are in turn filled with more people sentenced to Class D and C felonies, more people sentenced to misdemeanors, and more people held pre-trial, unable to pay bail. This approach encourages county and state elected officials to maintain high levels of local incarceration. Jails in eastern Kentucky stay full at an average of 140 percent of their rated capacity. Bell County in eastern Kentucky is at a whopping 224 percent.9

In 1990, the International Olympic Committee chose Atlanta to host the Centennial Olympic Games. Almost immediately, Atlanta’s City Council passed a series of “quality of life,” or “broken windows,” ordinances authorizing the targeting of low-level offenses. Nearly 100 percent of city ordinance arrests were of visibly poor Black people, sent to an already overcrowded county jail.2 In early 1995, one year before the Olympics, city leaders announced the completion of its first Olympic project (before a single sporting venue was complete): a shiny new jail, standing seventeen stories high in the heart of downtown Atlanta.3 Over the next two decades, the availability of beds in ACDC distorted nearly every public health and safety policy, making arrest and detention the default “solution” to houselessness, mental health crises, domestic violence, and substance use. It also supersized the power of Atlanta police to exert their authority over predominantly poor and Black neighborhoods.

Our lives under capitalism are in many ways disappointing and continually create negative feelings such as stress, resentment, depression, and loneliness. But we all have an attachment to particular ideas of what a good life should look like – one that often includes the very sources of harm. We often continue to aspire to these ideals of the good life, even when they continually let us down.

Emotion is elusive. It is not an object which we can easily identify and separate from other phenomena. Rather, in Alison Jaggar’s words, it describes a form of habit or a way of engaging with the world which escapes simple dichotomies of activity and passivity. Emotions presume language and social order, and they are closely linked to social values and modes of evaluation.2 Emotions such as anger or shame imply a social judgement of some kind, as do feelings of happiness and attachment. These social values have to be learnt. Feelings are rule-bound processes – they are not spontaneous eruptions but rather profoundly social phenomena which are learnt and managed by the subject. While often understood as something internal, a psychological state within the subject, emotion signals the subject’s involvement with the world.3 Emotions are not passive states that we simply endure, but neither are they things a subject can fully control or will into being. They form part of the very constitution of the subject itself, and are fundamental to constituting the subject as a social being. Emotion, then, should be conceptualised not as coming from within the subject, but rather as a form of interaction between the subject and the social, through which the subject becomes involved in the social world. This includes relations of power, which can become internalised through emotional processes. We learn to feel that existing power relations are natural and good, and that social change is wrong, unnatural, and frightening.

Ideology depends on such emotional investment – it is not just a mental belief but a way of feeling and relating to the world. Ideology would not stick without feeling. To some degree, ideology is feeling. It is through emotional reproduction that we come to invest emotionally in the right objects and the right futures. Through the privatisation of emotional reproduction, bad feeling becomes individualised. Emotional reproduction serves to smooth over malcontent with the dominant order, creating a belief that we can and should have satisfying emotional lives under capitalism. Emotional reproduction naturalises the world as it is and makes it appear as a desirable state of things – as long as we make the right choices and behave in the right way. If we are unhappy, we just need to manage our feelings better.

People are as yet unaware that the Russians are fascists, especially ordinary people. The industrialists and bankers are well aware of it. As for the Americans, people believe that money is the only thing that matters to them.

And that’s what so many people want to get at: the cause of the drug use, the reason people pick up substances in the first place. Anytime I talk about my work informally, I inevitably encounter someone who wants to know why addicts become addicts. They use words like “will” and “choice,” and they end by saying, “Don’t you think there’s more to it than the brain?” They are skeptical of the rhetoric of addiction as disease, something akin to high blood pressure or diabetes, and I get that. What they’re really saying is that they may have partied in high school and college but look at them now. Look how strong-willed they are, how many good choices they’ve made. They want reassurances. They want to believe that they have been loved enough and have raised their children well enough that the things that I research will never, ever touch their own lives.

I know that it’s easier to say Their kind does seem to have a taste for drugs, easier to write all addicts off as bad and weak-willed people, than it is to look closely at the nature of their suffering. I do it too, sometimes. I judge. I walk around with my chest puffed out, making sure that everyone knows about my Harvard and Stanford degrees, as if those things encapsulate me, and when I do so, I give in to the same facile, lazy thinking that characterizes those who think of addicts as horrible people. It’s just that I’m standing on the other side of the moat. What I can say for certain is that there is no case study in the world that could capture the whole animal of my brother, that could show how smart and kind and generous he was, how much he wanted to get better, how much he wanted to live. Forget for a moment what he looked like on paper, and instead see him as he was in all of his glory, in all of his beauty. It’s true that for years before he died, I would look at his face and think, What a pity, what a waste. But the waste was my own, the waste was what I missed out on whenever I looked at him and saw just his addiction.

“I think it’s beautiful and important to believe in something, anything at all. I really do.” She said the last part defensively because I was rolling my eyes. I’d always been annoyed by any whiff of the woo-woo, faux spirituality of those who equated believing in God with believing in, say, a strange presence in a room. In college, I’d once left a spoken-word show Anne had dragged me to because the poet kept referring to God as “she,” and that need to be provocative and all-encompassing felt too trite, too easy. It also went counter to the very concerns of an orthodoxy and a faith that ask that you submit, that you accept, that you believe, not in a nebulous spirit, not in the kumbaya spirit of the Earth, but in the specific. In God as he was written, and as he was. “Anything at all” didn’t mean anything at all. Since I could no longer believe in the specific God, the one whose presence I had felt so keenly when I was child, then I could never simply “believe in something.” I didn’t know how to articulate this to Katherine, so I just sat there, watching my bedroom door.

The implication that the family should be the primary source of care does not address the uneven distribution of emotional labour for those who are, for various reasons, excluded from the family. Nor does a politics that promotes equality within the domestic sphere account for the fact that the family is a privileged site of care because it structurally excludes those who are not participating in normative family arrangements. Rather than campaigning for men’s increased participation in domestic work, and state services to compensate when parental work is not enough, we should strive for the abolition of the family and its attendant relations of gender and labour. A successful reproductive revolution would have to intervene within the domestic sphere in order to undo the separation between the private and the public.

The political framework of family abolition has become increasingly well known over the past few years, but it is not a new position. The perspective has a long history in the communist tradition, and can be traced back to The Communist Manifesto. For Marx and Engels, the call to abolish the family stems from their rejection of the bourgeois family form, which is bound up with private property and men’s claim to ownership over their wives.29 Families are more than carriers of normative values. Families are work relations, and in particular a central site of emotional reproduction. The family is a privatised arrangement of work, care, and economic distribution, shored up by ideological and legal means. Furthermore, families function to structure kinship and lines of inheritance, or lack thereof – forms of (dis)possession that are tied to the reproduction of classed and racial difference. Sophie Lewis writes that ‘ “family” refers to “blood” ideology and organized care scarcity: a kind of anti-queerness machine for shoring up race/class and producing binary-gendered workers’.30 The family is tied up with the production of gender, the exclusion of queerness, and the continued reproduction of overlapping racial and classed dynamics. Family abolition is a necessary part of the abolition of private property.

What can account for the persistence of nuclear family models after the end of the family wage and the breadwinner model? One reason the family remains a hegemonic form, even as it has become more precarious and flexible than it was in the post-war period, is that we have failed to construct viable alternatives. The nuclear family appears increasingly unstable, as indicated by higher divorce rates and seemingly more inclusive norms surrounding family arrangements. This has led to a discourse of the family being in crisis. But no new model has taken its place, and access to care and resources often remains tied to membership in a family. People keep imagining familial relations as the source of the good life, despite how inadequate they are in terms of meeting the emotional and physical needs of most people.

In undoing the privatisation of family, we must also abolish the privatisation of feeling. The family under capitalism functions as a nexus of privatised emotional bonds. Emotional labour has to be refused for a feminist movement to be able to mobilise emotion in an emancipatory way. This refusal means doing emotion differently. I am not arguing against emotional care for other people. Rather, I want to articulate a politics in which we struggle against emotional reproduction as we know it – that is, tied up with forms of sociality and ideology that continually recreate and privilege privatised social bonds and hierarchically constituted subjectivities. Abolishing the family and gender involves the ungendering of emotion. It also involves moving away from niceness as the dominant good feeling, and accepting or even cultivating bad feeling. As a dominant family value of the bourgeoisie, niceness has a tendency to obscure social hierarchy, exploitation, and antagonisms. Niceness has a propensity to travel upwards in the social hierarchy, accumulating at the top and associating those at the bottom with bad feeling and emotional stigma. In order to abolish emotional labour and bourgeois family values, niceness has to be deprivileged as a socially desirable feeling. This might mean that we all have to live with some emotional discomfort, rather than allowing comfort to adhere to the most privileged. It would mean refusing the good life as we know it – a life of good jobs, home ownership, and proprietarian family relationships.

I worked hard on the first chapter of my book about the precolonial era in the Americas, where there were prosperous and urban civilizations without capitalism, and that is so hopeful. Most radical forms of anarchism now are anti-civilization, and they often look to Native people as the inspiration. They use Indigenous peoples, especially Native people in the Americas, pulling out what they want to justify their ideology. They are creating fantasies as evidence and even calling it science. Anarchists, especially the primitivists, view agriculture as the basis of all evil, because they are looking at agribusiness, and they don’t want to know at all that 90 percent of Native people in the Western hemisphere were agriculturalists—they don’t want to know that fact. So they romanticize Native people as “hunter-gatherers.”

January 2015, the Moricetown band council voted in favor of two agreements related to pipeline construction work: TransCanada’s Coastal GasLink project and Chevron’s Pacific Trails project (through the First Nations Limited Partnership). Meanwhile, the Unist’ot’en Camp kept on growing, particularly through the installation of new traplines in Wet’suwet’en territory and the erection of a health center for Native youth on site. In May 2015, the Unist’ot’en Camp sent out a call to urgent action while TransCanada started prospecting Wet’suwet’en territory to initiate the Coastal GasLink project. Chevron was also given a green light by the BC Oil and Gas Commission for clearing a passage to build the Pacific Trails Pipeline. In January 2019, the BC Supreme Court filed an injunction against the Unist’ot’en Camp even though a judicial process (initiated in the fall of 2018 by the National Energy Board (NEB)) looking at possible legal violations by the TransCanada project was underway. On January 7, armed with this injunction, the RCMP launched a large and aggressive paramilitary operation against the camp to take down the Wet’suwet’en blockade. All media were barred from accessing the site and surrounding areas by the police force, which also set up signal jamming and communication disruption devices to prevent media coverage of ongoing operations, essentially repeating the methods used during the RCMP attack on Ts’Peten / Gustafsen Lake in 1995. Fourteen land defenders were arrested that day (charges against them would be dropped in April 2019).

This distance from the people could be measured in the views of most Members of Parliament. The Presbyterian majority had been dragged reluctantly into the war and had prosecuted it feebly. They bowed reluctantly to Cromwell’s demands for a powerful fighting force. Even now he had done so much to win the war for Parliament, Cromwell could rely on only a minority of about 100 ‘Independents’ in the House of Commons, and many of them, including Cromwell himself and the 18 relatives he could count upon on the Commons benches, were more worried about their estates than about the future of parliamentary democracy. The glaring truth about Parliament was that it was an assembly of rich men chosen overwhelmingly by rich men for the purpose of safeguarding and extending the property of rich men.

Though habeas corpus was restored in 1800, the repression continued. To the long list of repressive laws, the Government added the Combination Acts. They forbade the annoying habit of workers in the new mines, mills and factories combining into trade unions to improve wages and conditions. In the first few years of the new century, there was so little outside agitation for reform that ministers convinced themselves that they had put an end to the unwelcome subject once and for all. There were plenty of petitions to Parliament protesting about corrupt elections, but none of those irritating motions calling for reform of the representation. Burke died in 1797, and Paine in America in 1808, and most of the ruling politicians from both parties comforted themselves that the ferocious argument that had so shaken the country in the 1790s had gone for ever.

Manchester, a city divided by a huge spinners’ strike in 1818, was the centre of that agitation. A series of mass meetings in other northern cities culminated in a mighty reform celebration and picnic on 16 August 1819 at St Peter’s Fields, Manchester, from where the Blanketeers had set off two years earlier. The propertied minority were so apprehensive about the meeting that they dragooned a large consignment of armed ‘yeomen’ to police it. The yeomen were infuriated by the sight of Henry Hunt arriving in his carriage to speak to an orderly and peaceful meeting of some 60,000 people on the sole subject of parliamentary reform. Before Hunt could utter a sentence, the yeomanry spurred their horses on to the crowd, flashing their sabres. They killed 11 and injured at least 140.

As the formidable alliance of Government and employers broke the workers’ organizations, they also passed the new Poor Law Amendment Act. The Act had one purpose: to cut the relief paid to the poor. That relief amounted to about a fifth of the national budget. Under the old system, poor-relief money was allocated by local parish worthies, most of whom got the money back in rent or in their shops. The new Whig system abolished all such relief and provided only workhouses, where poor people of all ages and in all states of health mingled in scenes of unutterable degradation. The workhouses were prisons for the poor. Control over them passed from the parishes to a bureaucracy of commissioners who paid themselves huge salaries and concentrated on forcing the budget down. The rationale for the new law came from Thomas Malthus, who argued that there were too many people in the world and followed his logic through to its inevitable conclusion: that poor, old and sick people who could not fend for themselves should be left alone to die. The architect of the new Act was Lord Brougham, a Whig grandee who had keenly supported the 1832 electoral reforms. Malthus, Brougham and the Secretary of the Poor Law Commission, Ewan Chadwick, were a detested trinity on whom the early Chartist orators, especially Stephens, poured a river of abuse and mockery. Harney called on his audiences to put the Malthus doctrine to the test. ‘Let those who do not labour leave the land, let those who work not leave the country, and when the aristocracy betake themselves to Van Diemen’s Land and the moneymongers to the devil, take my word for it, there will be enough for you and me.’ Nothing went down better with his half-starved audiences than this mockery of the rich ‘reformers’. Every year since 1834, Harney went on, the miseries of the poor had increased. Not a single one of the confident predictions of the free-market Malthusians had come true. Wages had not gone up – they had come down. Employment had not gone up – it had come down. In Carlisle, he had only to gaze at the anxious and emaciated faces in front of him to appreciate the appalling fact that a quarter of the population were starving. Labour had not become more mobile. It had become more static, trapped in hopeless deprivation. Yet this abominable Poor Law Amendment Act, which he called the Poor People’s Destruction Act, had sailed through the House of Commons with only 50 votes against.

The news of the vote was passed on to an already inflamed mass movement. Since the Chartist Convention had adjourned at the beginning of May, the delegates had been engaged in a ceaseless array of public meetings in every town and city in the country, all of them demanding the vote and all of them threatening dire consequences if it was denied. The meetings were bigger than ever before. Even in small, relatively comfortable towns like Bath, thousands of people turned out to cheer the speakers and swear vengeance on the authorities. The meetings were combined with disturbances and riots, the most prolonged and serious of which were in Birmingham. The authorities had plainly decided to teach the Chartists a lesson even before the petition came to Parliament. In the week before the Commons vote, a gang of newly recruited Metropolitan policemen – called ‘Peelers’ after their founder, Sir Robert Peel – tried out their new equipment and powers on an unarmed and peaceful demonstration in Birmingham’s Bull Ring, a traditional place for public meetings. Declaring the demonstration illegal and seditious, the police charged into the crowd batoning anyone in range. The crowd showed none of the meekness that had cowed the demonstrators at Peterloo 20 years previously. They fled the batons, regrouped in the narrow streets around the Bull Ring and charged the astonished police with tremendous ferocity, wounding many of them with railings torn from the side of the streets. The police were pursued to their quarters, battered, abused and humiliated. The riots went on at Birmingham throughout 12 July 1839 – the day of the Commons vote – and afterwards. Young people everywhere started to respond. The youth of working-class England, and Scotland too, was on fire.

The defeat of the Newport uprising was celebrated by the Whig Government with another round of repression. By the middle of 1840 almost all the known leaders and many lesser-known followers were rotting in jail or on their way to join John Frost in Van Diemen’s Land. Very few of them returned to politics. Stephens vanished from the Chartist scene. O’Brien, though he continued to write and speak for the Charter, forsook his former militancy. The Whigs and their judges had two aims – to cut the head off Chartism and to expunge for ever the chilling memory of the revolutionary year of 1839. In the first they were entirely successful, in the second not so. Twice again, in 1842 and 1848, the Chartist revolt smashed its way into the heart of bourgeois England. These two other waves of revolt, which were progressively less mountainous and less threatening, had the same basic features as in 1839. There was, first, the same economic background – a trade depression that plunged the working class into unimaginable distress. The distress contrasted grotesquely with the growing luxuries of the rich that derived from unchecked exploitation, in which the governments of both parties (Whig in 1839 and 1848, Tory in 1842) excelled. Unemployment, unabated by any system of public welfare, was rife. A Factory Inspectors’ Report in the spring of 1841 showed that half the working population of most industrial towns in Lancashire, the West of Scotland and the West Midlands were out of work, and the wretchedness of those in work was constantly being increased by systematic wage cuts against which there was no appeal and no recourse. Many new Chartists were made that year out of fathers and mothers who had to starve so that their children could eat. Workhouses and prisons were regularly raided for bread by gangs of starving workers. Another trade depression at the end of 1847 plunged the country back into conditions almost as bad as in 1842. In Ireland, they were much worse. In the six years from 1845 to 1851 more than a million Irish people died from starvation. The Government’s experts as usual blamed famine on the weather or, more typically, on the starving people themselves. The real cause was exactly the same in both years as in 1839: exploitation, encouraged and subsidized by Whigs and Tories and their shared enthusiasm for the ‘free market’. The chief response from the impoverished masses in both years was constitutional and passive. As in 1839, their main political activity was the collection of signatures for a petition to Parliament to enact the Six Points of the Charter. In 1842, the petition, presented to Parliament on 3 May, dwarfed its 1839 predecessor, with 3.5 million signatures. In 1848, though enthusiasm for a third petition had waned, the lowest estimate for genuine signatures was 1.5 million. In both years, the petitions were summarily and insultingly rejected by the House of Commons. In 1842, the vote against even hearing the petitioners was 236 to 49, and in 1848, the petition was packed off to a committee, where it was denounced as a fake, and never even debated.

Want’s bitter bondage binds us to their feet – we are oppressed because we are poor. The joys of life, the gladness of plenty and the sympathies of nature are not for us.

In a passage widely quoted in later months, Lowe gave vent to his contempt, fear and even hatred for what he called the ‘swarming millions’. ‘If you want venality, if you want ignorance; if you want drunkenness and facility for being intimidated; or if you want impulsive, unreflecting and violent people, where do you look for them in the constituencies? Do you go to the top, or do you go to the bottom?’ The question was left unanswered. Most objective observers hunting for venality and violence might have gone to the top, to the people responsible for the Crimean War, for child labour, for the starvation of the working masses or for widespread banishment and capital punishment of offenders. Robert Lowe was looking in the opposite direction, to the victims of exploitation rather than to its perpetrators.

Despite this mobilization for reform, however, the popular mood was still very different from that of the Chartists. The demand was still for political concession rather than economic egalitarianism. The Reform League leaders, right and left, called on their supporters to avoid any reference to the ‘physical force’ slogans of O’Connor, Harney and O’Brien in the early years of the Chartists. But the mood was changing so swiftly that no one could guarantee that the movement for reform might not, in the event of one of those accidents Bright had warned about, change into a movement for revolution.

The most striking result of the 1867 reform was that all the terrified predictions by the Tories and the Adullamites about its revolutionary consequences were comprehensively disproved. The new electorate, still a minority, quickly and submissively merged with the minority it replaced. The ‘great estates’, the end of which Lowe had mourned, were not only secure – they actually increased their influence in Parliament. There were more nobles and sons of nobles in Gladstone’s Liberal administration of 1868 than there had been in 1865. The working-class reformers who had demanded more labour representation in Parliament were so delighted with what they got in 1867 that they immediately, and unsuccessfully, started to seek office within it. The trade-union leaders who had unconditionally supported the Chartists and had sat with Marx on the General Council of the First International preferred, after 1867, to concentrate their attention on the Liberal Party.

From early on, the old rulers were disposed to spread the franchise. Though they never intended voters to represent any more than their own class interests and their own bigoted views, they were excited by the idea that they were representing something more democratic. On the other hand, they were terrified that by allowing people without property into the process they endangered their own property. From 1852 to 1867 they dithered on the brink of franchise extension without plucking up the courage to take the plunge, and were finally pushed by forces outside Parliament. There was never any major concession on franchise reform without some sign that people would fight for it. The concessions were not voluntary. They were not inspired by the ingenuity, generosity or democratic spirit of the politicians.

From early on, the old rulers were disposed to spread the franchise. Though they never intended voters to represent any more than their own class interests and their own bigoted views, they were excited by the idea that they were representing something more democratic. On the other hand, they were terrified that by allowing people without property into the process they endangered their own property. From 1852 to 1867 they dithered on the brink of franchise extension without plucking up the courage to take the plunge, and were finally pushed by forces outside Parliament. There was never any major concession on franchise reform without some sign that people would fight for it. The concessions were not voluntary. They were not inspired by the ingenuity, generosity or democratic spirit of the politicians. Each one of them in 1867 and in 1884 was wrung out of Commons and Lords by mass agitation and mass action.

Though the Liberal Party organized some of that agitation, the two most decisive concessions – the Hodgkinson amendment in 1867 and the submission of the Lords in 1884 – were secured when it became obvious, as it had done in 1831, that even the most radical representatives in Parliament had lost control of the action outside and that what John Wilson disparagingly called an ‘avalanche’ of political activity had been set off against the politicians’ will.

After a two-day debate in July 1910, the Bill was carried by 109 votes, and immediately sent to a committee of the whole House, thus ensuring that at least until the second general election of 1910 it was doomed. Studying the division lists, Brailsford and his colleagues were surprised to see the name of Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill, Home Secretary, as an opponent. Churchill had given an assurance to the Conciliation Committee that he would support the Bill, and had even allowed his name to be published as a supporter. Brailsford had the first clear sign of the duplicity of the Liberal politicians with whom he was dealing.

In Liverpool and Dublin, Orange and Green banners joined in the strikers’ demonstrations. In South Wales, the police went on strike. So did schoolchildren – in 1911 alone there were 62 school strikes, most of them in South Wales. The number of workers involved in strikes in 1911 was 961,800 – 300,000 more than in any previous year. More than 10 million days were ‘lost’ (or won) in strikes, about a day for every member of the industrial population. Trade-union membership in that single year grew by 600,000.

Mrs Pankhurst went on to explain the WSPU’s new turn to militancy. First, she insisted on intractable opposition to all three political parties that made up what she called the Coalition Government. The Labour Party, which was cooperating everywhere with constitutional suffragists and, as we have seen, was committed from that year to opposing any measure for increasing the franchise if it did not include women’s suffrage, was singled out for special attack. ‘We have summoned the Labour Party to go into opposition to the Government on every question until the Government do justice to women.’ This was effectively a demand that Labour oppose everything proposed by the Liberal Government – Home Rule for Ireland, for instance, or the payment of pensions through a national insurance scheme – until votes for women were conceded. This represented a sharp shift from the WSPU’s previous position, which was neutral towards the Labour Party except on franchise questions. Then Mrs Pankhurst turned to the real meaning of the new WSPU policy: a new interpretation of militancy. ‘There is something,’ she said, ‘that governments care for far more than they care for human life, and that is the security of property. Property to them is far dearer and tenderer than is human life and so it is through property that we shall strike the enemy.’ Mrs Pankhurst quickly pointed out that she herself was ‘no enemy to property’. The attack on property she was advocating was ‘only an instrument of warfare in this revolution of ours’. Owners of property attacked by the WSPU should, she argued, go to the Government and insist on the removal of the causes of the attack on property and grant the suffrage to women. She ended with a furious appeal that brought the audience to their feet, cheering: Those of you who can break windows, do so. Those of you who can still further attack the sacred idol of property so as to make the Government realize that property is as greatly endangered by women as it was by the Chartists of the old days, do so … I incite this meeting to rebellion.

and his subsequent stint as chairman of the Midland Bank. McKenna resolved at the outset that he would not preside over any further martyrdom by the suffragettes. Yet he did not stop the forcible feeding. Physical and verbal abuse of the most disgusting kind was tolerated and even inspired by the prison authorities. McKenna’s most heroic legislation was the Temporary Discharge of Prisoners Act (1913), whereby forcibly fed prisoners who showed signs of physical weakness could be released – but only for as long as it took them to get better, when they could be arrested and imprisoned once again. This peculiarly loathsome law became known as the Cat and Mouse Act, under which scores of desperately ill hunger strikers were released, rearrested, released and rearrested all over again. The passing of the Act, which was supported by the majority of MPs in all parties, including the Labour Party, itself became a cause for further demonstrations and further hunger strikes. Mary Richardson, a ‘mouse’, was sentenced on 18 July 1913, for throwing an inkpot through a window of a police station in protest against the Cat and Mouse Act. She was sentenced to a month’s hard labour, went on immediate hunger strike and was released five days later. Five days later she was arrested again, and shortly afterwards released. The process of arrest and release went on for nearly a year until finally, a few days before war broke out, Mary Richardson was released with acute appendicitis, her mouth and body torn to shreds by the fingernails of prison officers. The persistence of the hundreds of women bruised and battered in this way was matched blow for blow by the savagery of the authorities. When anyone sings the praises of the great reforming Liberal administration from 1906 to 1914, the roles of Harcourt, Asquith and Lloyd George in deceiving the campaigning women and of Churchill and McKenna in torturing them should never be forgotten.

This speech ushered in the final stage of the suffragette movement, which lasted for almost two years until the outbreak of the First World War. As the suffragettes grew more militant, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet hardened in their implacable opposition to women’s suffrage. Their so-called Reform Bill – always a trick – was formally dropped. Any amendment to it to extend male suffrage to females was ruled out of order. The sly double-dealing with which leading ministers like Lloyd George and Churchill pretended to support the women’s cause, and even befriended the friends of the suffragette leaders, vanished. In its place came repression and cruelty against the women who continued the campaign. Forcible feeding continued apace. Reginald McKenna had become Home Secretary in October 1911. He brought from the Admiralty a reputation for orthodoxy and militarism, which he carried with him through his long Cabinet career – and his subsequent stint as chairman of the Midland Bank. McKenna resolved at the outset that he would not preside over any further martyrdom by the suffragettes. Yet he did not stop the forcible feeding.

The type of violence in which the WSPU engaged in 1913 and 1914 – stone-throwing at Government window panes, setting fire to postboxes, restaurants, railway stations, etc., false fire alarms (there were 425 in 1912 and even more in 1913), desecration of paintings and historical relics and interruption of sporting events like the Derby – was of a different order from that of the 1830s. But the real difference was not in the type of violence but in the nature of its support. The violence of the 1830s represented the fury of the masses. It symbolized much more than support for a single demand about the franchise. It was the expression of a revolutionary ferment that threatened not just the property of the rich but also their ability to hold on to that property. Men like Macaulay recognized that violence for what it was – a revolutionary warning. Moreover, the violence was spontaneous and sporadic. It was impossible to tell where it would strike next. It came from below. The suffragette violence of 1912 and 1913 by contrast came on orders from above. It had wide support among women but it had none of the class character that so terrified the Whigs and their class in 1830 and 1831.

In the debate on the Representation of the Bill in May 1917, Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour leader who had taken a back seat during the war, announced that he was in favour of adult suffrage. ‘Why,’ he asked with some force, ‘didn’t these arguments about women getting the vote apply in 1911 and 1912’, when the Government had been so hostile to women’s suffrage? No one answered his question then, and different answers came from feminists and historians all the way through the twentieth century. One common answer is that in 1916 and 1917, the people who ruled Britain were confronted with the real possibility of a social revolution and were pushed by the revolutionary tide towards enfranchising almost the entire adult population.

Nor could they explain the quite extraordinary conversion of so many important people in Government, business and the press to the case for votes for women. Much more significant was the miraculous vindication in every town, city and workplace of what Engels had argued in 1884.

Though women were by no means liberated from hundreds of years of patronizing subservience, many of their shackles were weakened or smashed. A quarter of the hundreds of thousands of women in domestic service left it. A third of the women who had surrendered to domestic tyranny in the home became workers with independent lives. For the first time in centuries, there were clear signs that what Engels described as the historic defeat of the female sex was halted and even reversed. These dramatic changes in the economic conditions of women and the economic circumstances in which they found themselves was a crucial cause of the sharp shift in high society which resulted in all the main demands of the suffrage movement being so suddenly and noiselessly granted.

These lines between normal and abnormal sex tend to be drawn in a couple of different ways, both of which cause many problems. One way of drawing the line distinguishes “real”, “proper”, “normal” sex from forms of sex that are seen as somehow inferior. For example, the lists of sexual “disorders” or “dysfunctions” in psychiatric manuals like DSM-5 make it pretty clear that what they mean by “sex” is penis-in-vagina intercourse ending in orgasm. This view filters into sex therapy, self-help, and popular culture meaning that anyone who prefers other kinds of sex—all or some of the time—can easily feel inferior. Ironically this is actually likely to lead to more sexual problems, and even non-consensual sex, happening, as people try to conform to the “right” kind of sex and the “right” amount of sex in their relationships, rather than tuning into what they actually enjoy. It’s hard to be present to the experience you’re having if you feel like you have to have an orgasm in order to be having “normal sex”. It’s difficult to enjoy oral sex or mutual masturbation if you’ve been taught that it’s only “foreplay” and not “the real thing”. And why is solo sex generally seen as somehow lesser—or more suspicious—than sex with other people when it can be one of the greatest pleasures many people enjoy?

The other way the line between normal and abnormal sex is drawn separates “proper” sex from sex which is seen as risky or dangerous. For example, sex advice books often save “spicy” or “kinky” sex for the final chapter, and stick a load of health warnings around it as if being tied up or spanking somebody is inherently more likely to lead to harm than penis-in-vagina sex. Again psychiatric manuals have whole lists of “paraphilias”, many of which are things that it’s perfectly possible to enjoy consensually like dressing up, or taking dominant or submissive roles during sex. These lines lead to a lot of guilt and shame around sex, especially given that kinky fantasies are hugely common—just look at the popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey. Again this can mean that many people are never sexually fulfilled because they can’t bring themselves to admit to their desires. Or it can mean that people do try to bring kink into their sex life, but in ways that aren’t as safe or consensual as they should be because they’re too embarrassed to communicate openly about it.

You could say that the sex/not-sex line is an important one because it’s necessary to delineate appropriate from inappropriate behavior—in a workplace environment for example. But again we would argue that consent is the more useful concept to consider here. Is everybody fully informed about what’s going on? Is everyone involved able to provide consent and legally of an age at which they can do so? Is it clear enough that they can choose to participate or not, or ask for more information? What are the power dynamics in play, and how possible is it for consent to happen given these dynamics?

When Alex used to be pregnant, one of the most frequent questions they were asked—besides if it was okay for complete strangers to touch their belly—was whether they were expecting a “boy or a girl”. People seemed confused when they happily declared that they were hoping for a baby hippo, but that it was probably a tiny human they were growing. This is not an unusual scenario as this question is often asked of pregnant people. If we gently pointed out that people are asking to know what the genitals of an unborn baby are so that they can non-consensually classify them according to an arbitrary and scientifically incorrect system of sex and gender, they would probably be confused, or even angry. Sex and gender can indeed be confusing terms, with a range of meanings. For many people sex/gender is also its own binary.

MJ writes… For me being non-binary is about embracing multiple sides of myself which are differently gendered. I like my non-binary pronoun “they” not just because it is gender neutral, but also because it can be used in both the singular and the plural sense. I experience myself as pretty plural. Being non-binary enables me to embrace the more masculine sides of myself which I was discouraged from expressing as I was growing up. My gender is definitely a work in progress. As I learn to understand and embody these different sides of myself the overall “me” gradually shifts and changes in exciting—and sometimes challenging—ways.

Are they really “trans enough” if they don’t want to change their name, or maybe even their appearance?

Another complexity of going towards the “not-drawing-lines” side of the binary is that there are real differences between the everyday lives of different people who might claim inclusion into a bi, or non-binary, community. For example, a woman who is married to a man but occasionally snogs a woman on a night out and doesn’t mention it does have a different experience of bisexuality to a person who is out about being bi at work, and has partners of more than one gender.

A person who is visibly gender non-conforming and requests gender neutral facilities has a very different experience of walking through the world to one who looks conventionally gendered and accepts using the expected toilets, changing rooms, and so on.

Also, vitally, as gender scholar Ros Gill points out, you can never step completely outside of culture. We can recognize the flaws in the gender system: how it is rooted in problematic hierarchical binaries, and means many different things at the same time, none of which are based in either biological or cultural universals. At the same time we grew up under that system and it is all around us all of the time. That means that all of us have to locate ourselves in some way in relation to that system. If we don’t we risk being completely unintelligible to the people around us, and to ourselves, in ways would make everyday life difficult, if not impossible.

As with the sexuality and gender binaries, the together/single binary obscures all the relationship possibilities that are available between and beyond singledom and coupledom. For example solo poly people have multiple relationships from the place of being an independent unit, and there are also many living apart together couples (LATs) who find that this works very well for them, as well as those who live as part of more communal homes or extended families. Expanding this binary would give us much more scope for finding the relationship with ourselves and with others that works best for us, at any given point in time.

Basically when we’re open to having a fully consensual relationship with ourselves and with others, and do not expect one person or a small nuclear family to meet all of our needs, the landscape of intimacy opens. What does it open up onto though? If intimacy means more than the closeness of a family unit, or a euphemism for sexual intercourse, what other types of intimacies are available to us?

“I find the disability and Deaf labels incredibly powerful. I was brought up to think there was something really wrong with me because of my Deafness, so when I found Deaf community, sign language and Deaf pride, it was revolutionary. I know many Deaf people don’t consider themselves disabled. I agree that we’re a linguistic and cultural group in our own right. However, I also want to draw attention to how I’m disabled by society, that’s why I like using both disabled and Deaf.”

One way of looking at disability which profoundly challenges the binary model of people being either disabled or not disabled is the social approach. Social models of disability locate disability in society rather than in the individual. For example, stairs are something that disable people, rather than disability residing in the body of an individual person who uses a wheelchair.

Finally, social models of disability regard all of us as interdependent, rather than suggesting that people with disabilities are dependent in order to shore up a myth of everybody else being independent. Being reliant on a carer, for example, is part of a wider system of interdependency which includes the reliance that everybody has on those who produce our food, remove our garbage, and run public transport. The cultural emphasis on health and being “normal” place bodies with disabilities at the margins because people don’t want to be reminded of their interdependency, limitations, pain, and mortality.

We also live in a culture which encourages the very kind of self-critical thinking that’s a feature of all the most common mental health problems. The French philosopher Michel Foucault famously used the analogy of the panopticon prison for our culture. In this prison there’s a single guard sitting at the top of a central tower in the middle who is able to see into all of the prison cells. Prisoners end up monitoring their own behavior all of the time, just in case they might currently be being watched. Foucault argued that our culture works in this way through all of the pressure we’re under to self-improve, and to present a positive, successful self to the world. We’re made to feel fear that we might be lacking or failing in some way, and we’re sold products which claim to help us to allay those fears. Makeover shows, self-help books, and beauty products are some of the more obvious examples. Social media also encourages us to maintain the illusion of perfection online, leading to endless rounds of self-evaluation and comparison.

However, mental health systems can be very resistant to such views. In Users and Abusers of Psychiatry, Lucy Johnstone suggests that it is very tempting for mental health practitioners to treat clients or patients in an “us (well) and them (ill)” way because of how invested they are in the current system. There’s the danger that, without such clear splits, their job security would be at risk. Also they would lose the sense of expertise and professional power that they have if, for example, there was a de-medicalizing of distress or a de-professionalization of support for people who were struggling. There is a danger, more widely, that those who have an investment in being seen as sane, in control, and professional, require a comparison group of those who aren’t. This may play out in mental health systems, in families and other groups, and in society at large. Mad pride and communities of survivors of mental health systems endeavor to address these issues in their work.

Where does this leave us with diagnosis? We could resist any form of diagnosis as a way of individualizing and medicalizing problems, which are actually highly social and cultural, and for reinforcing mad/sane binaries. However, diagnoses can be incredibly helpful for people too. Rather than trying to come to a binary good/bad decision on diagnosis, perhaps it’s more useful to ask what it opens up and closes down for people, being mindful that it can often do both.

Taoist parable demonstrates our tendency to view everything in terms of “good” and “bad” and the suffering this can cause: The situation…is like that of the wise Chinese farmer whose horse ran off. When his neighbour came to console him the farmer said, “Who knows what’s good or bad?” When his horse returned the next day with a herd of horses following her, the foolish neighbour came to congratulate him on his good fortune. “Who knows what’s good or bad?” said the farmer. Then, when the farmer’s son broke his leg trying to ride one of the new horses,the foolish neighbour came to console him again. “Who knows what’s good or bad?” said the farmer. When the army passed through, conscripting men for the war, they passed over the farmer’s son because of his broken leg. When the foolish man came to congratulate the farmer that his son would be spared, again the farmer said,“Who knows what’s good or bad?” When do we expect the story to end? This links to the Buddhist take on suffering, which suggests that suffering lies—not in the events of life which are bound to be painful at time and wonderful at times—but in our responses to them whereby we try to cling on to the “positive” experiences and avoid or eradicate the “negative” ones: just as the neighbour wants to celebrate or commiserate.

Lloyd George’s speech was made to a meeting of Liberals and others to whom the Welsh wizard was anxious to explain his decision to split the Liberal Party and lead a Coalition Government made up mostly of Tories. In his speech he explained that he had joined up with the Tories to forestall a victory of the Labour Party, which he described as a socialist party ‘which strives for the collective ownership of the means of production’. Liberalism, he declared, stood above all else for private property. Such was the size and preponderance of the British working class that ‘this country is more top-heavy than any country in the world and if it begins to rock, the crash here … will be greater than in any land’. Lenin concluded therefore: ‘The reader will see that Lloyd George is not only a clever man, but that he has learned a great deal from the Marxists.’

The Labour Party took 20 per cent of the votes, an enormous increase on the 6 per cent it won in December 1910, but only 57 Labour MPs were elected (compared to 42 in 1910). Considering the rise in the electorate, Labour’s performance was disappointing. The Party in Parliament lost its undistinguished leader, Arthur Henderson, who had resigned from the War Cabinet in 1917 at least partly because of his short-lived enthusiasm for the first Russian Revolution. The leadership passed to even more dreary and chauvinistic figures – William Adamson and J. R. Clynes. They concentrated not on policy – there really was no distinctive Labour policy throughout the war – but on building up Party organization. Those ILP leaders who had the guts, however half-heartedly, to oppose the war – men like Ramsay MacDonald at Leicester, Philip Snowden at Blackburn and W. C. Anderson at Sheffield – were all annihilated at the polls and Henderson, savaged by Lloyd George for his alleged treachery over Russia, lost his seat in East London.

The immediate result was a huge increase in the number of strikes, many of them led by shop stewards who felt no loyalty to the war or to the Government. Indeed, many of them were infuriated by the Government’s introduction, in the spring of 1916, of conscription – a move that enabled many employers, in league with the Government, to isolate militant stewards and victimize them.

Twice in that revolutionary year of 1919 great armies of organized labour steeled themselves for a fight with the Lloyd George Government. The first threat was by far the most potent. In a ballot whose result was announced in February, the miners voted by 615,164 to 105,082 to strike in order to restore the miners to something like their pre-war standard of living. The demands were for an immediate 30 per cent wage rise and a six-hour day. Another demand was for the nationalization of the coal industry. Lloyd George, thrown on to the defensive, played for time. If the miners would drop their action, he proposed a Royal Commission headed by one of the very few judges believed to harbour Labour sympathies, Mr Justice Sankey. He proposed that the Miners’ Federation and supporters among Labour intellectuals, led by Sidney Webb and the historian R. H. Tawney, should sit on the commission. Despite a howl of protest from the miners’ rank and file (and from Workers’ Dreadnought, a socialist paper edited by Sylvia Pankhurst), the miners’ executive agreed to postpone the strike. The hearings of the Sankey Commission were a devastating indictment of private ownership in general and of the coal-owners in particular. The greed and incompetence of the owners were contrasted daily to the sickness, injuries and poverty of the miners. In its interim report, the Commission concluded: ‘Even upon the evidence already given, the present system of ownership and working in the coal industry stand condemned, and some other system must be substituted for it, either nationalization or a method of unification by national purchase and/or by joint control.’ In a Labour Party pamphlet published in 1919 recommending the nationalization of the coal industry, R. H. Tawney, already a dedicated Labour propagandist, recorded that ‘one by one the defences of the present system were reconnoitred and overthrown’.

Beaten the miners certainly were, and there was no strike by the Triple Alliance all through the storms of 1919. The ‘40-hours strike’ by shipbuilding and engineering workers in Glasgow at the beginning of 1919 was defeated in scenes of appalling state violence, at the end of which one of the strike leaders, Emmanuel Shinwell, was sent to prison. The railwaymen came out in a solid strike in September, but went back after ten days with no substantial gains. Workers did win victories in smaller strikes all over the country. Nevertheless the constitutional challenge thrown down to the Triple Alliance leaders by Lloyd George gave the Government and the employers the breathing space they needed to survive.

During the first few months of 1921 an idea started to gain favour among the Labour councillors. This was to raise a lower rate than previously, and to refuse to pay the London County Council for the police, the water boards and the asylum boards. The money raised could go instead to the Poor Law Guardians so that they could pay more to the unemployed. After the proposal had been discussed at great length at Labour Party gatherings throughout the borough, it was endorsed with only one vote against by the full council on 22 March 1921, just a fortnight before Black Friday. The rate levied by the council for the following three months was 4 shillings and 4 pence compared to 6 shillings and 10 pence, which the council would have raised if they collected the London County Council precepts for police, water and asylums. The bold decision to defy the law on council finance was taken in a mood of self-confidence at least in part inspired by the tumultuous developments in the mines and on the railways. Many of the transport trade unionists involved in the discussions before Black Friday were dockers from Poplar.

Even more determined and persuasive was his son Edgar and his niece Minnie, one of four women councillors in Poplar who were among the first women to be elected as councillors anywhere thanks to the changes in the franchise in 1918. The Lansburys’ determination to resist the law was shared by all 30 Labour councillors, many of whom had been groomed in the SDF and brought up in the spirit of trade-union militancy before, during and after the war. In the first week of September, the 30 began to be arrested for contempt, and were carried off to Brixton prison or, in the case of the four women, to Holloway. They had prepared their electorate for this crisis and had secured their support.

The story of Poplar and the rates rebellion of 1921 irritates traditional historians and Labour constitutionalists. Jimmy Thomas, the hero of Black Friday, dismissed the whole effort as ‘a threat to the constitution’. Herbert Morrison poured scorn on the Poplar councillors who, he insisted, by breaking the law had set back Labour’s magisterial progress to respectability. In his book Consensus And Disunity (1979), perhaps the most comprehensive history of the Lloyd George post-war coalition, Kenneth O. Morgan wrote of the Poplar episode: ‘It was magnificent but it was not politics, even if George Lansbury acquired the mantle of martyrdom. Nor was it electorally popular. Poplarism cost Labour dear. The Party won 143 seats on London Boards of Guardians in 1919, only 112 in 1922.’ This analysis conveniently ignored the real effect of the Poplar revolt – the equalization of the Poor Law rates. Under a compromise rapidly hammered out after the councillors were released from prison, it was agreed that the costs of Poor Law relief should be shared across London. This had been the main demand of the councillors when they refused to collect the precepts.

Another definition of ‘Poplarism’ became common usage in the language of the Labour movement for long after 1921. Its real meaning was expressed again and again by anguished Labour councillors who found that they could not use their powers as elected councillors to alleviate the plight of the people who voted for them. ‘The workers,’ said George Lansbury, ‘must be given tangible proof that Labour administration means something different from capitalist administration.’ Charles Key, another imprisoned Labour councillor, made the same point in a different way. ‘We have come to make a change,’ he said. They understood that if an elected Labour council carried on its business in exactly the same way as its Tory predecessor, the electorate would in due course become bored or cynical or both. The eventual beneficiaries would be the Tories or the Liberals, the people responsible for the dreadful conditions working people had to endure. The Poplar councillors quickly discovered that they were hemmed in on all sides by an economic system over which they had no control. More infuriating still were the regulations and the unelected accountants who, in the clear interests of the rich minority, prevented the elected councillors from carrying out policies to benefit the poor. On all sides, it seemed, the elected councillors were frustrated by the economic ‘realism’ of the capitalist world and the host of district auditors and other unelected ‘regulators’ with draconian powers over the councillors.

Bernstein argued against what was then the received view in the German Social Democratic Party – that socialism could only come by revolution. That view had, according to Bernstein, been transformed by the progress of the suffrage and the election of substantial numbers of socialists to the German Parliament. This offered a more credible and less violent course for socialists, he argued. Instead of the vagaries and unpleasantness of revolution, socialists could now concentrate on getting votes to Parliament. If they got enough votes for a majority – and why shouldn’t they as the workers were the majority in society? – they could legislate for socialism, and eventually bring about public ownership by constitutional, parliamentary methods. Bernstein’s pamphlet provoked a furious response from the revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg, who argued in a scorching pamphlet that those who sought to change the system by parliamentary methods were not really seeking the same aims as the revolutionaries, ‘but a different goal’. Luxemburg’s argument soon lost ground on the German left. The long German Revolution of 1918 to 1923 eventually petered out and the Social Democratic Party held on to office by parliamentary means. One of its leaders’ early democratic initiatives was to arrange the murder of Rosa Luxemburg.

In the election for Party leader in late November, MacDonald beat Clynes by five votes – 61 to 56. Almost at once, the rejuvenated Parliamentary Labour Party put down a historic motion on the House of Commons order paper. It was debated over two days in 1923 – 20 March and 16 July. The motion, entitled Capitalist System, encapsulated the hostility to capitalism and the commitment to gradualism that had dominated most of the new Labour leader’s thinking over the past two decades: That, in view of the failure of the capitalist system to adequately utilize and organize natural resources and productive power, or to provide the necessary standard of life for vast numbers of the population, and believing that the cause of this failure lies in the private ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, this House declares that legislative effort should be directed to the gradual supersession of the capitalist system by an industrial and social order based on the public ownership and democratic control of production and distribution.

By the time the first Labour Cabinet was announced, it was clear that the new Government intended no threat at all to the status quo. There was one representative of the Labour left – John Wheatley, Minister of Health, which included housing. He was balanced by two declared Tories, Lord Parmoor, who agreed to become Lord President of the Council, and Viscount Chelmsford, the former Tory Secretary of State for Air as First Lord of the Admiralty. The Lord Chancellor, second in rank to the Prime Minister, was the Liberal Lord Haldane. Thus the two opposition parties could claim the allegiance of three Cabinet ministers in the first Labour Government. Others on the list were scarcely likely to breathe confidence into the Labour rank and file. The new Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson, was MacDonald’s golfing friend at Lossiemouth. The new Secretary of State for War, Stephen Walsh, was so overcome by the top military brass over which he now had nominal control that he told them: ‘I know my place. You have commanded armies in the field when I was nothing but a private in the ranks.’ Even more penitent was Jimmy Thomas, the new Secretary of State for the Colonies. He was a proud speaker at the Chamber of Trade in his native Newport, to which he admitted: ‘I once wrote a book, When Labour Rules. It was a foolish thing to do. It was in the days when I bothered about material things and wanted money. Although in the book I set out very clearly how to govern the Empire, when on Monday morning my principal private secretary comes to me, I cannot very well say to him, “Yes that is a very serious problem, and the answer is found on page 28 of the book.

So profound was the effect of Cook’s campaign and so desperate the crisis affecting the mining industry that when, in the summer of 1925, the owners locked out the miners and made clear their intention to cut miners’ wages, the new Tory Government, unprepared for the furious union resistance that followed, including a ban on coal movements organized by the revived Triple Alliance, hurried forward with a subsidy to tide the owners over for the next nine months. In the enthusiasm over what became known as Red Friday, many trade-union leaders assumed that the subsidy would continue indefinitely. That was never the intention of the Tory ministers or of their Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin. Their oft-proclaimed independence from the coal-owners was symbolized by Baldwin’s appointment as his Minister of Labour of Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, a coal-owner. Any hesitation in the ranks of the Cabinet was swiftly dispelled by hardened class warriors such as their new convert from Liberalism, Winston Churchill, and the veteran reactionary barrister Lord Birkenhead. Such men were kept awake at nights by the awful humiliation they suffered as a result of a Government subsidy for the miners. The central purpose of Government, in their view, was to protect employers from the menace of subversives like A. J. Cook. They accepted the subsidy with grudging reluctance, and only on the unconditional assurance that it would end the following May and that the entire machinery of the state would be organized on the employers’ side for the confrontation that would follow. In the nine months from the summer of 1925 to the spring of 1926, every sinew of the state was applied to the single objective of defeating the miners in open conflict. The police were trained to deal with riots and demonstrations; the press lords got special briefings from Cabinet ministers, their reporters showered with ripe gifts of information about the private lives and communist sympathies of TUC leaders such as George Hicks and Alonzo Swales. A new strike-breaking force called the Organization for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS), entirely free of trade unions, was set up for the distribution of vital food and raw materials. The Government then annexed into their class army their prosecutors and judiciary. In the same month as the birth of the OMS, the entire executive of the Communist Party was arrested, charged and convicted on the slenderest evidence of seditious libel, an offence almost unheard of since the repressive Tory Government of 1817, and incitement to mutiny under an Act dating back to the naval mutinies of 1797. Some Communist leaders, including their General Secretary Harry Pollitt, were sent to prison for a year, a sentence that kept them out of action the following spring. Other trials and convictions of miners’ union militants took place in South Wales.

By the beginning of the second week of the strike, it looked as if it must succeed. Succeed in what, however? Much was made at the time and since of the prospect of the strike turning into a revolution. By far the most graphic and detailed account of the strike, Christopher Farman’s The General Strike, published in 1974, carried the sub-heading: Britain’s Aborted Revolution. At the time, however, even in the newspapers of the Communist Party, there was hardly a reference to revolution. The truth was that the General Strike was in furtherance of a trade-union demand – the protection of the miners’ standard of living – and the deployment in support of that demand of the maximum power of the organized labour movement. It was, in modern terms, a sympathy strike in which workers not immediately affected by the dispute stopped working solely in the economic interests of other workers. The overwhelming majority of workers who responded to their General Council’s call did so in the hope and belief that the Government would concede the miners’ case and either take over the mines themselves and deal decently with the miners, or at least continue the subsidy which they themselves had granted the previous year. These concessions were easily within the grasp of ministers. They had already ‘afforded’ the subsidy for nine months and there was no reason, economic or otherwise, why they should not continue to do so. The Tory Cabinet, however, had a different view. Urged on by Birkenhead, Churchill, Steel-Maitland and other class warriors, they regarded the General Strike as a threat to the very fabric of the social order: namely their own class power. To them, the General Strike harked back over the centuries to the argument at Putney between the Levellers and the generals. If we give them the vote, argued Cromwell and Ireton, the people will seize our property. In 1926, Churchill and Birkenhead repeated the argument in slightly different form: If the strikers can tell us what wages we should pay the miners, they are seizing from us the control of society. Will they not then begin to tell us how else we are to run the society? The two arguments seemed on the face of it a long way apart, but there was some substance in the alarm of Churchill, Birkenhead and the others. For if the strike turned out to be successful, the organized workers would indeed have staked their claim to run society. A truly democratic power would have been established that went far beyond the power of Parliament. The General Councillors of the TUC would have shown that they could successfully challenge the employers even in circumstances where the elected Government ranged itself unconditionally on the employers’ side. This was the significance of the tug of war between the classes fought out in May 1926. By the start of the second week of the strike, the issue was very much in doubt, with the balance shifting towards the workers. There was no sign of a drift back to work. The machinery of society was seizing up. It was decided not by the people on strike, nor by the employers nor by the Cabinet, all of whose members remained obdurate. The issue was decided by the TUC General Council, whose leaders, terrified of victory, opted for surrender. On Wednesday 12 May, the General Council trooped into Downing Street to tell the Prime Minister that the strike had been called off without any concessions to the miners. The slogan had been ‘not a minute on the day, not a penny off the pay’, but the settlement accepted by the General Council meant substantial wage cuts with increases in working hours. There was no guarantee from the employers to lift the lock-out notices, indeed no guarantee by the owners to do anything at all. There was not even an assurance that there would be no victimization of strikers. The General Council that had gone into the battle assuring their affiliated unions that they were to be ‘their Parliament’ had not even recalled the executives to debate the surrender. In the name of their members, they abandoned the struggle so unconditionally and on such humiliating terms that even Lord Birkenhead was embarrassed by it. The surrender of the trade-union leaders in Downing Street, he wrote to his colleague Lord Halifax, was ‘so humiliating that some instinctive breeding made one unwilling even to look at them’.

What lay behind this astonishing surrender? Partly, it was the hard work put in by the members of the General Council who were implacably opposed to the strike in the first place. Chief among these was Jimmy Thomas, the railway union’s leader. In 1921, Margot Asquith, wife of the former Prime Minister, wrote to him exulting in his presence at a society dinner, and urging him ‘to keep tight hold of your men’. As we have seen, he followed this instruction with almost religious fervour during the great strikes of 1921, and, in the atmosphere of industrial peace and good will that he had helped to create, settled down in relief to a career in parliamentary cretinism.

Thomas’s approach won the day for the employers and the Government not only because of his own prejudices but because all the trade-union leaders, right and left, shared his terror of victory. All were apprehensive about winning the dispute they had started. Even the trade-union leaders of the left Alonzo Swales and George Hicks, both of whom had travelled to Russia and voiced support for the revolutionary government there, feared the prospect of a victory, as it would threaten what the union leaders regarded as the very core of their existence: the delicate equilibrium between employers and workers negotiating with one another. During the strike, the story gained momentum of a trade-union official negotiating with employers and reporting back to his workers. ‘I can get you rises of £10 a week,’ he exulted. ‘Not enough,’ was the reply. ‘Well, at a pinch, £20 a week?’ implored the official. ‘Not enough,’ was the reply. ‘Well, what is it you want then?’ shouted the exasperated official. ‘We want the social revolution!’ replied a loud voice. ‘Oh no,’ replied the official. ‘Management will never agree to that.’

‘Labour and the Nation’, the programme on which the election had been won, had been specific on this point. The Labour Party’s socialism, it declared, was ‘a conscious, systematic and unflagging effort to use the weapons forged in the victorious struggle for political democracy to end the capitalist dictatorship in which democracy finds everywhere its most insidious and relentless foe’. This was the clearest possible statement that capitalism was an undemocratic system and that its antidote, socialism, could be achieved through democratic means, through the ballot box. It was not clear from the rest of ‘Labour and the Nation’ or indeed from the 1929 Labour Party manifesto precisely how this democratic conversion was to be achieved.

In Britain in 1936, the year of the fascist generals’ uprising in Spain, the publisher Victor Gollancz started a Left Book Club, hoping for a membership of five or six thousand to revive socialist ideas. He, John Strachey and Harold Laski selected books of the month that were then available free to club members. The club soon outstripped Gollancz’s most extravagant hopes. By 1939, membership had climbed to 57,000, ensuring a readership for the books of the month beyond the wildest dreams of any author. Many of the books were based on reportage – from the pits, from prisons, from China, Spain, Italy and Germany. The political line was almost uniformly that of the Communist Party, to which, in the Club’s halcyon years, Gollancz, Cripps, Strachey (who was a Party member in all but name) and, to a lesser extent, Laski all adhered. The line demanded slavish support for what was then known as the Soviet Union, but was in fact the Russian Empire. Books such as I Went to the Soviet Arctic (1939), Moscow 1937 (1937) and anything by Pat Sloan preached the most abject subservience to the Moscow line. Anything that smacked of Trotskyism or dissidence was immediately rejected. Scores of books about Spain peddling the Party line were published, while the best piece of reportage from the front line of the Civil War, George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia (1938), was not even considered. Nor was Black Jacobins (1938), C. L. R. James’s glorious account of the Haitian Revolution led by the slave Toussaint L’Ouverture and its connection with the French Revolution, though a much inferior book on the same subject became the Club’s book of the month. The only real argument between the selectors was over the draft of a small book by H. N. Brailsford, Why Capitalism Means War (1938), which made a few sharp criticisms of the Moscow show trials, and the judicial murder of old Bolsheviks in Russia. Gollancz and Strachey were utterly opposed to such a shocking deviation, and would have turned the book down had not Laski threatened to resign in protest.

Seventy years later, it is easy to see the frightful flaws in the Communist position. The first was that the Party, like its equivalents in the rest of Europe, became an arm of Russian foreign policy. This was seen by many Communists as its main attraction, when the horrors of Stalinism were not as obvious as they should have been. Yet one of its many drawbacks was the continual chopping and changing of both policy and principle. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, for instance, Communist policy had insisted that social democrats were as much a threat to peace and progress as were the fascists. To prove this theory, Stalinists invented the venomous (and ridiculous) phrase ‘social fascists’, which was liberally sprayed over ILP and Labour Party supporters, left and right alike. The theory was adopted wholesale by the German Communist Party whose leader, Ernest Thaelmann, summed up his perspective in the memorable phrase: ‘After Hitler, our turn.’ After Hitler, Thaelmann and his supporters were at last united with the social democrats – in Nazi concentration camps and torture chambers.

The Nazi–Russian pact brought the unity of the left, so studiously built up by Communists during the years of the Left Book Club, to a shuddering halt. All three of the Club’s selectors abandoned the Communists. Gollancz commissioned a Left Book entitled The Betrayal of the Left (1941), in which he, George Orwell, Arthur Koestler and others roundly denounced the pact and its Communist sympathizers. Strachey, in his new book, A Programme for Progress (1940), cut his Communist connections. So did Cripps. So did Laski. The Left Book Club continued to publish outstanding titles without ever again achieving the circulation or enthusiasm of the late 1930s. At Tribune, Aneurin Bevan took over the editorship and hauled the paper back from the Stalinist abyss, employing the arch-enemy of Stalinism, George Orwell, as literary editor with a weekly column.

Public opinion polls conducted by YouGov in 2021 found that when people in Britain were asked about the general ‘concept’ of the police, the majority of people sampled thought they were doing a ‘good job’. However, when asked to consider the reality of policing – for example, how effective police actually were in their local area, around half of respondents expressed low or no confidence in the police. Office of National Statistics (ONS) data likewise show that public confidence in the police declined from about 62 per cent expressing confidence in 2017–18, to 55 per cent in 2019–20.6 When YouGov asked about the London Metropolitan Police in particular (whose current strategy states that its vision is ‘for the Met to be the most trusted police service in the world’7), trust rapidly declined, particularly among people aged eighteen to twenty-four.8 This could be attributed to the fact that the actions of the Met Police have been widely communicated in popular media: it was the Met Police who were found to be ‘institutionally racist’ in their response (or lack thereof) to the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993. It was during a Met Police raid in 2011 that reggae star Smiley Culture died from a stab wound.

The criminal-legal system was not set up to reduce harm in society, but to protect private property and the interests of capital and ‘imperial expansion’ – the practice of a state growing its power and domination through military and colonial expeditions in other regions. The law functions as a key component of capitalism, meaning that it upholds a system where the priorities of powerful and wealthy elites are elevated above the lives of everyday people. We see this demonstrated in the types of ‘crime’ that the law recognises, and the communities it places most frequently in its crosshairs – it is a crime to ‘steal’ formula milk you cannot afford to feed your hungry baby, but not a crime to cover high-rise buildings in highly combustible cladding.

Despite good intentions, training individuals within an inherently violent institution won’t lead to the diffusion of non-violent praxis throughout the force.

Information gleaned on trainings is merely absorbed and integrated into the unspoken objective of the police, becoming further arsenal to use against the marginalised communities they largely interact with. I spoke with Lucy McKay from INQUEST, a charity that provides expertise on state-related deaths to bereaved families and their lawyers, and she explained some of the impacts of training the police. She outlined how training police on mental health has had the consequence of equipping them with a larger portfolio of excuses that can be leveraged when somebody dies after police contact. A range of symptoms and behaviours such as being fearful, agitated or aggressive have been grouped together and termed ‘acute behavioural disturbance’ (ABD) or ‘excited delirium’. McKay explained how describing someone’s behaviour using the umbrella term ABD has been utilised as a smokescreen for their murder by police: ‘What’s supposed to happen is, it’s supposed to be a medical emergency and you’re supposed to respond by contacting an ambulance, as you shouldn’t restrain someone who’s exhibiting these symptoms. But what actually happens is often [the police] do exactly the same things that they would have done [without mental health training]. But then at the end, they go: “Oh, they had ABD, didn’t they?” And then that’s almost the excuse for why they died.’

Policing by consent is an instruction which was given to the first Metropolitan Police officers in 1829 and relied on the idea that if police applied the law fairly and with ‘minimal force’, acted with transparency, and provided opportunities for the public to provide feedback on local policing, the public would not seek to disrupt them in their duties. A Home Office freedom of information (FOI) release in 2012 expands on this idea, describing Britain’s ‘policing by consent’ approach as ‘unique throughout the world’ as it is ‘derived not from fear but almost exclusively from public co-operation’.25 This tidy definition overlooks the fact that coercion in a context of fear can look very much like co-operation. When the alternative to ‘co-operation’ is to encounter the criminal-legal system, ‘consent’ cannot freely be given. After all, the government’s own definition of coercive control – ‘a purposeful pattern of incidents that occur over time in order for one individual to exert power, control or coercion over another’26 – is also an accurate description of policing.

Carceral feminism is premised upon a limited vision of who is entitled to safety, justice and liberation; who needs saving; and who is beyond redemption. Carceral responses to feminist issues on the whole employ binary understandings of gender and are primarily invested in the protection of cisgender women and their freedom from ‘male’ violence. This concentration on ‘male’ violence against women obfuscates harms experienced within, for example, queer relationships or as enacted by parents of any gender against children, or by state agents of any gender against individuals and communities. It reduces issues of structural inequality to one of interpersonal disputes – a bitter war between men and women with a clear-cut villain and a straightforward victim. Carceral feminism’s simplistic men-versus-women battle also overlooks the experiences of people who are racialised; carceral feminists have nothing to say about the racism of the state or the police, or about the racism of individual white women.

Orwell noticed that the left-wing spirit in the country seemed to grow hugely as the British war effort failed. The nadir of that effort was in 1942, in Africa, when the British were defeated at Tobruk. The military disasters stoked up political rage against the Government. From 1940, the Government was a coalition. War Cabinet positions were shared between Tories and Labour. The Labour Party had endorsed its leaders’ decision to join the coalition, and colluded in an electoral truce whereby neither party would fight by-elections in seats held by the other. In those anxious days in 1942, the truce was challenged not by official Labour but by Independents standing on vaguely radical platforms. In March, Denis Kendall, a manager of a local engineering firm with a liberal reputation, decided to stand, without organization or resources, against Sir Arthur Longmore, a former air-force chief and an unrepentant imperialist, in a by-election in the safe Tory seat of Grantham. The Communist Party, eager to demonstrate its enthusiastic and patriotic support for the war, threw its resources behind Sir Arthur. But Dennis Kendall won the seat with 50.8 per cent of the poll. This triumph for anti-Government forces was repeated the following month (April 1942) in another rock-solid Tory seat, Rugby, by the trade-union leader and former Labour MP W. J. Brown, who came to the constituency at the last moment, stood as an Independent and beat another Tory knight, Sir Claude Holbrook, winning 51.8 per cent of the vote. The same day, an even more remarkable victory over the Tories was notched up in Wallasey, Merseyside, by George Reakes, a former supporter of Neville Chamberlain. Standing on an anti-Tory platform, Reakes took 60.6 per cent of the vote and reduced the Tory vote by 35 per cent. These three upsets were followed almost at once by the extraordinary triumph of Tom Driberg, a young left-wing journalist on Lord Beaverbrook’s Daily Express. At Maldon, in darkest Tory Essex, Driberg called himself Independent Labour and fought the campaign on the weaknesses of Churchill’s war strategy and on socialist policies which he went on supporting for the rest of his life. In a far bigger turn-out than in the other by-elections (44.4 per cent), Driberg won 61.3 per cent of the total vote to the Tories’ 31.3 per cent. The reaction of the Labour leaders to these results was to try to force Labour supporters in the constituencies not just to stand aside at by-elections in Tory-held seats but also actively to campaign, speak and canvass for the Tory nominee. This was too much for most local Labour parties, who openly flouted their leaders’ instructions.

Regulation 1AA, which made it a criminal offence to incite workers to go on unofficial strike. The Regulation was proposed by the Minister of Labour, Ernest Bevin, and was approved by the House of Commons, though most Labour MPs abstained from voting. The Regulation was Bevin’s response to a rash of unofficial strikes in the mines, most of which had been successful. It was agreed and defended by the General Council of the TUC, most of whose members saw unofficial strikes as a threat to their authority.

The basic conditions he had set down for such action were now fulfilled. Labour had achieved an impregnable parliamentary majority for an openly socialist programme (the Labour manifesto had proclaimed: ‘the Labour Party is a socialist party and proud of it’). According to Cripps’s own prescription in the 1930s, now, if ever, was the time for immediate emergency legislation to assert the control of the elected Government over the capitalists who controlled the economy. Now was the time to demonstrate the Government’s repugnance for ‘continuity of policy’. But these pre-war commitments seemed almost totally to have vanished from the mind of Stafford Cripps. As President of the Board of Trade, and later as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he devoted himself to reassuring the people of the Government’s acceptability. He associated himself with slightly messianic ideas of self-sacrifice and austerity, and the only book he published during the five years he held high office was a slim volume of Christian sermons.

By far the greatest achievement was that of Aneurin Bevan in facing down the opposition of doctors to his proposals for a national health service. To herald the creation of the National Health Service, the Government’s Central Office issued a leaflet for mass distribution in February 1948 whose plain language reflected the spirit of the times every bit as much as those posters outside the nationalized pits: Your new National Health Service begins on 5 July. What is it? How do you get it? It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care. Everyone – rich or poor, man, woman or child – can use it or any part of it. There are no charges, except for a few special items. There are no insurance qualifications. But it is not a ‘charity’. You are all paying for it, mainly as taxpayers, and it will relieve your money worries in time of illness. Thus was born, at a time of almost unrelieved national economic crisis, by far the most popular institution in Britain for the next half century and beyond.

The thinking (if that is the right word) behind what later became known as ‘Morrisonization’ was best expressed not by Morrison but by the President of the Board of Trade, Sir Stafford Cripps. In a speech in October 1946, Cripps put a novel interpretation on his insistence in 1933 that a new Labour Government must devote itself to ‘a complete break with what has gone before’. ‘There is not yet a very large number of workers in Britain,’ he lamented, ‘capable of taking over large enterprises. Until there are more workers on the managerial side of industry, I think it would be almost impossible to have worker-controlled industry in Britain, even if it were on the whole desirable.’

Most commentators on the post-war Labour Government agree that the Government’s six years in office had two distinct periods. Until the end of 1947, the new ministers were almost entirely absorbed in the nationalization and welfare Acts. When these were on the statute book, the momentum slowed. Ministers seemed to lose their conviction and their unanimity. Left-wing ministers like Bevan and Griffiths demanded more nationalization and more egalitarian measures, while other ministers, led by Morrison of the old school and Gaitskell of the new, called for a pause in the socialist advance and a period of ‘consolidation’. These arguments between socialists and consolidators broke out all over the place – in Parliament, where the Tories started to regain their confidence; in the ministries, where the ‘consolidators’ were cheered on by the civil servants; and in the Labour Party National Executive, where the debates raged about the nationalization of iron and steel, which had been in the Labour Party manifesto, and the nationalization of the insurance companies, which had not.

In his book on the period, Labour in Power (1984), Kenneth O. Morgan dismisses the claim that what he calls ‘the supposedly hostile constitutional structure’ can in any way be blamed for the failures of the Labour Government. He recalls with some derision the view of Labour theorists in the 1930s ‘that the system itself – the monarchy, the House of Lords, the civil service, the City and attendant capitalist institutions, the sources of information and communication – were hopelessly biased against a Labour Government’. He shows that throughout that post-war Government, the monarchy stood aside, the House of Lords was called into effective opposition only once (on the Steel Bill, as a result of which its delaying powers were heavily restricted), and the civil service remained effectively neutral. But what of ‘the City and its attendant capitalist institutions’? Paradoxically, Morgan’s account gives more than a glimpse of how the extra-parliamentary power of money and wealth played havoc with the Labour Government, especially in the year of the turn, 1947, and in the run-up to the devaluation of sterling in 1949. An economic crisis was caused in August 1947 by the earlier decision of the Labour Government to make sterling ‘convertible’ into dollars from that date, in exchange for a hefty loan from the United States. The result was, Morgan reported, ‘a tidal wave of selling’ and ‘a huge outflow of capital’. The Cabinet, according to Morgan, was ‘brought to its knees’ and ‘the strength and virility of the Labour Government fled, never to return’. The same picture was painted in the other outstanding history of the period, Never Again! (1992) by Peter Hennessy. After describing a dithering Prime Minister, a drunk Foreign Secretary and a distraught Chancellor, Hennessy concluded: ‘The Cabinet had no real idea what to do as the gales of the world economy roared in through the door opened by the restoration of convertibility.’

In September, the President of the Board of Trade, Harold Wilson, who, at 31, had only just been appointed as the youngest Cabinet minister to take such office since universal suffrage, sent a note to Dalton outlining another reason for the crisis. Speculators, he observed, had spent the whole crisis feverishly betting against the value of sterling and in the process causing untold damage to the British economy. This was the first inkling Wilson had of the menace of currency speculators, later dubbed the gnomes of Zurich, who wreaked such havoc on the Labour Governments he later led. The convertibility crisis taught the Labour ministers a grim lesson about the unseen market forces that could, when least expected, change the course of elected politicians. Almost exactly the same thing happened two years later, in 1949, when the same manic selling of sterling forced the Government, against the inclination of Attlee, Cripps and Bevin, to devalue the pound.

Bruised and perplexed by the two flights of sterling in 1947 and 1949, confused by the split between the majority of ministers who were scared to move further forward and the small but powerful minority who insisted that they must, the Government became increasingly susceptible to the calls to stand still and ‘consolidate’.

In two important areas in that empire, Labour supervised partitions of old colonies that resulted in the retrenchment of deeply reactionary and privileged minorities.

Communist-controlled North Korea invaded South Korea, an ally of the capitalist West, and the United States eagerly leaped into the fray. The US looked to their old ally Britain for economic and military aid in the Korean War. Both were readily forthcoming. Gaitskell in particular, then and for the rest of his career, proved a doughty supporter of the United States Government. He drew up a stiff budget to meet the demands of rearmament, asking for £4,700 million – an enormous sum at that time – much of which would have to come out of other Labour plans for public spending.

Eventually the two formally made up their quarrel in time for the 1959 election. But Bevan could see the slow disintegration of Labour’s commitment to public ownership and economic democracy, the main sign of which was the contempt which Gaitskell and his acolytes showed for democracy within the Labour Party, whether in or out of Parliament. The process of argument and discussion that was so vital to the health of the Labour Party was restricted by rigid parliamentary rules, enforced by the diktat and intrigue of the Party leadership. Thus, for instance, the group calling itself the Bevanites in the Parliamentary Labour Party was, after two years, denounced as ‘a party within a party’ and banned. The Gaitskell leadership was bitterly opposed by the rank and file in the constituencies and their elected representatives to the National Executive. The Gaitskell faction always triumphed, thanks to the support of the trade-union leaders and their block votes at conference. Yet when some trade-union leaders broke ranks, and helped the constituencies to a historic victory on the issue of unilateral nuclear disarmament in 1960, the Gaitskell faction promptly organized a campaign to reverse the vote – a campaign which was formalized and even named, the Campaign for Democratic Socialism, and which was a more active and relentless party within the party than anything the Bevanites ever attempted.

The book drew some angry reactions from the left. In Tribune, Will Camp, who had fought Solihull for Labour in 1950, advised Crosland to reread Rogow and Shore on the power of private enterprise over the post-war Labour Government, and reflect on how much more devastating that power might be if a future Labour Government proceeded in the illusion that it could take economic power without resorting to public ownership. But mostly, as Will Camp predicted, Crosland’s book was hailed and glorified. When I went to Oxford University in 1958, The Future of Socialism was the most widely discussed and the most influential of all political theory. It swung the intellectual pendulum away from traditional Labour remedies and towards the Gaitskell leadership. No book since the war had as powerful an effect on the politics of the Labour Party.

The best account of the crisis of the summer of 1965 comes from Clive Ponting, a civil servant who climbed to the top of the Ministry of Defence and who was prosecuted in 1984 for leaking secret documents about the sinking of the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano in the Falklands War. In 1989, he published a book about the 1964–70 Labour Government entitled Breach of Promise. He revealed for the first time that behind the backs of the Cabinet, a deal was struck between the British and American Governments. In exchange for the United States helping the pound and staving off British devaluation, the British Government would deflate the economy at home, initiate a statutory incomes policy, back the American war in Vietnam and, most importantly, maintain a substantial military force East of Suez. All these things happened – every one of them in direct breach of Labour Party policy and the Government’s intentions. In his Bevanite days, Harold Wilson had eloquently opposed Western imperialism in Indo-China, whether French or American. Labour Party policy was opposed to the American invasion of Vietnam, to deflationary measures and to wasteful defence spending on the old imperial pattern. Yet in secret meetings with their American counterparts and under the constant threat of an economic crisis they did not create, understand or halt, the Labour Government embarked on all these policies.

The July measures were agreed without dissent by the Cabinet and hailed in the right-wing press. But the effect on the Labour movement, and on Labour voters, was catastrophic. In 1967, Labour lost control of the Greater London Council and hundreds of council seats. By-elections came and went, all with enormous and unprecedented slumps in the Labour vote. In September and November, Labour lost marginal Cambridge and then safe seats at Walthamstow, Leicester South West and even Hamilton, near Glasgow, where its vote slumped by nearly 30 per cent. Seats occupied by Labour for the whole century were now being won by Tories or Nationalists. As they deserted their voters, Labour ministers stayed true to the forces that had not elected them, true to the American barbarism in Vietnam, true to the one-sided pay pause, true to the pound sterling. The last of these commitments was constantly threatened until in November 1967 it was jettisoned. After another bout of sterling sales, the Government finally devalued the pound.

The devaluation ushered in another set of unelected masters, this time from the International Monetary Fund. They were brought in to ‘advise’ on the measures now necessary to ‘sustain’ the devaluation and they insisted, first, on the restoration of NHS prescription charges and the postponement of the raising of the school leaving age. When Labour ministers argued that both these were the precious heritage of the Labour Party, the IMF insisted all the more firmly for their inclusion in the package. On the day after devaluation, Dick Crossman asked James Callaghan to ensure that the Government raised family allowances for the poor. Callaghan replied, ‘Sorry, old boy, the IMF won’t allow it.’ Crossman ruminated, ‘so we’re back under the control of the bankers’. Not that they had ever been out of it.

The Tory Government’s frenzied attempts to ban Spycatcher ensured it a massive circulation, but the book itself turned out to be almost unreadable, full of quaint and boring anecdotes, puffed up with prejudice. At the end, however, Wright suddenly disclosed the deep hatred and suspicion of MI5 officers for their Prime Minister. In the 1960s, he revealed, MI5 had worked closely with their agent, Cecil King, chairman of the Daily Mirror, in his futile and risible attempt to replace the elected Labour Government with a National Government under Lord Mountbatten. In the first period of Wilson government, ruthless and reckless activity by MI5 officers had driven one Labour minister, Bernard Floud, to commit suicide and another, Niall MacDermot, to resign his office. Wright’s book claimed that in 1974 the attack on Wilson from his own intelligence officers was far more virulent than anything that had taken place in the 1960s: The approach in 1974 was altogether more serious. The plan was simple. In the run-up to the election which, given the level of instability in Parliament, must be due within a matter of months, MI5 would arrange for selective details of the intelligence about leading Labour Party figures but especially Wilson to be leaked to sympathetic pressmen. Using our contacts in the press, and among union officials, word of the material contained in MI5 files and the fact that Wilson was a security risk would be passed around.

The year turned out to be one of consistent horror for the Labour Government, a horror from which it seemed ministers could never recover. The Government borrowed money from the International Monetary Fund to stem the adverse flow of sterling. The first tranche of IMF money came in December 1975, and the flow continued all through 1976. Naturally the IMF wanted security for its loan, and the security it wanted was cuts in public spending on hospitals, roads, schools and even in the money the Government gave to industry to help it invest. All these were imposed by the Labour Cabinet, with only the occasional gesture of revolt from the back benches. In March, a substantial number of left-wing backbenchers voted with the Tories against the Government, but the consequent Government defeat was reversed by a vote of confidence. On and on, through the spring and summer, went the drain on sterling and the demand for more cuts in public spending.

The first ‘wave’ of feminism began in Europe and North America in the nineteenth century, so the story goes, and was focused on property rights and the right to vote (or ‘suffrage’). The second ‘wave’ in the 1960s and 1970s, we’re told, sought to reconfigure women’s role in the home and in public spheres, including reproductive rights. The third ‘wave’ in the late 1990s is defined by the ‘feminist sex wars’, with pornography and sex work (and the condemnation of both) emerging as divisive issues.2 A potential ‘fourth wave’ of feminism emerged in the 2010s. This wave was characterised by the use of the internet as a site of organising and activism, focusing on criminal-legal responses to rape culture, media sexism and sexual harassment in public spaces, university campuses and the workplace, as well as grappling with the limitations of the movement as we inherited it, via an ‘intersectional’ analysis. This era of feminism is undergirded by the period of economic downturn which began with the 2008 financial crisis and unfolded with the decade of ‘austerity’ that followed.

If we pivot our understanding of resistance away from feminist activities that are most photographed and best documented, and towards organising which centres justice and freedom from patriarchal structures in a context of racial capitalism, our vision of the movement takes on a much vaster, more vibrant and more liberatory aspect. The way in which we understand the past – especially in terms of whose resistance matters – influences our perspective on struggles in the present.

Such arguments are premised upon the very eugenicist logics which were used to justify colonial oppression. This school of thought found feet in Britain in the early 1900s, along with concerns about falling birthrates and the poor health of young men: both issues which would affect the recruitment of soldiers to the army. ‘Healthy’ reproduction was central to the eugenicist vision, and some suffragists latched onto these ideas to emphasise the value and importance of women in British social life, and to push for the right to vote.16 Eugenics was supported across the political and class spectrum, including by socialist women such as Beatrice Webb (who coined the term ‘collective bargaining’), and Marie Stopes, the founder of the first contraception clinics, who saw birth control as a way to prevent the reproduction of people she deemed to be unfit parents. Eugenicist arguments in this era for effectively breeding better soldiers dovetailed with the creation of state-provided free school meals, and the 1911 National Insurance Act which provided a small sum of money towards the cost of childbirth. These legislative shifts, underpinned by anxiety around Britain’s military deficiencies, in part paved the way for the creation of the welfare state, which would also be hailed as a feminist victory.17

Other women, however, felt limited by the ‘constitutional’ tactics adopted by the conservative NUWSS, and sought a more militant approach to try and secure wider gains. In 1903 another coalition of suffrage groups was formed in Manchester by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia: the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU). The WSPU became known as the ‘suffragettes’: the diminutive ‘-ette’ was used by the Daily Mail to try and belittle their efforts, but was quickly reclaimed. The WSPU’s direct action tactics included chaining themselves to railings, smashing windows (on one activist’s hammer was written ‘better broken windows than broken promises’), damaging infrastructure by setting postboxes on fire, destroying telegraph cables and carrying out arson and bomb attacks on buildings including the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh and Holloway Prison.27

A decade after its formation, the WSPU faced a seismic political fracture. This split is not unique to the suffrage movement – fragmentation is perhaps the defining characteristic of British feminism, a detail that has largely been pushed into the background of historical accounts until relatively recently. While the more radical East London branch of the WSPU led by Sylvia Pankhurst was steered by the needs and interests of working-class women, the rest of the WSPU was increasingly guided by Emmeline and Christabel’s more authoritarian and liberal agenda. Some suffragettes, disenchanted by the lack of working-class solidarity expressed by the elder Pankhursts, left the WSPU, such as the secretary of the WSPU’s first London branch, Eliza Adelaide Knight, who used walking sticks. Knight was active in the WSPU’s window-smashing campaign alongside her comrade Rosa May Billinghurst, who was a wheelchair user, and would use her wheelchair to ram crowds during actions.

Another suffragette who had been the WSPU’s general secretary, Norah Elam, also joined the BUF, alongside suffragette Mary Richardson, who had previously slashed a Velázquez painting in the National Gallery in protest against the imprisonment of Emmeline Pankhurst. Richardson become the leader of the Women’s Section of the BUF, and opined, ‘I feel certain that women will play a large part in establishing Fascism in this country.’53 In 1934 she also wrote an article in the BUF’s periodical paper The Blackshirt explaining why she had embraced fascism. Richardson drew on her suffrage lineage as a spiritual training ground for her participation in the BUF: ‘I was first attracted to the Blackshirts because I saw in them the courage, the action, the loyalty, the gift of service, and the ability to serve which I had known in the suffrage movement.’

Yet these stories about the formation of precious spaces, gatherings, uprisings, celebrations, services and publications pushing back against state racism were for many decades relegated to the footnotes of history.

What was the effect on the Labour Opposition of this Tory rampage? Initially, the anti-union laws and the privatizations were strenuously opposed in Parliament. But as the laws were passed, and the workers were defeated in open struggle, the Opposition began to founder. After the 1983 defeat, the new Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, appointed two of his promising young backbenchers, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, to the Commons committee dealing with the latest of the anti-union laws. Both young men opposed the Bill chiefly on grounds of democracy. ‘The Bill,’ said Tony Blair, ‘has nothing to do with democracy – it has everything to do with the rights of British trade unionists to organize freely in the association of their choice.’ The young MP was swimming in familiar waters. He was a barrister specializing in trade-union law, and in the early 1980s had written articles attacking the earlier Tory proposals for trade union ‘reform’. He argued these were not reforms at all, but a strengthening of the employers and the rich against the ability of trade unions to organize against them.

The delegates rose for the solemn ritual of the standing ovation. There were some perhaps old enough to remember the sleepless nights put in by a former leader of their party when he was Minister of Fuel and Power, Hugh Gaitskell, as he steered the nationalization of electricity (and gas) past an outraged Tory Party. In 1989, and the surrounding years, Labour MPs were moved to similar cheers as their leaders denounced the privatization of steel, aircraft, shipbuilding, gas, coal, water and, most shocking of all, the railways. In each case, Labour’s reaction to privatization threatened the very future of the newly privatized industry. If Labour was indeed going to take the industry back into public ownership, the security of the new stock was threatened. What was the use of buying shares in a privatized industry if a new Government that might be elected at any time was going to renationalize it? So Labour’s reaction to the privatizations was closely studied by the new monopolies and their armies of banks and investment advisers. They were all greatly relieved as the commitments made so hotly at the time of the privatizations were hastily abandoned. Even as early as the 1992 election, the Labour Party manifesto had dropped the commitments to bring electricity, water and the others back into public ownership. Tony Blair’s proud boast, for instance, to reinstate electricity as a public service was replaced by a vague commitment to extend public control of the industry. In each case, by the 1992 election, the new private monopolies born out of dogma and reared on deceit could relax in the knowledge that the dogma and the deceit – and the profit – would be continued under a future Labour Government.

Side by side with this enthusiastic commitment to do nothing to upset the rich and powerful, the authors developed an authoritarian and disciplinarian tone toward those who they felt were failing the nation. Labour in the past, they claimed, had been soft on crime, and that had to stop. There should be more imprisonment, more punishment. The middle class were fleeing state schools and the National Health Service and this was not the fault of the Tory attacks on both but mainly the fault of the ‘educational egalitarians’ who cared too much about the structure of schools (were they selective or comprehensive?) rather than their standards. There should be more discipline for ‘inadequate parents’ and a ban on benefits for those who refuse to participate or who drop out.

Liddle’s devotion to an open democratic society was revealed during the ‘cash for access’ scandal that emerged in 1998. Masquerading as an American businessman who wanted to do business with top people, Observer journalist Gregory Palast recorded Liddle boasting about his influence and power. Referring to a young researcher, Derek Draper, employed by Peter Mandelson, Liddle was quoted as saying: ‘There is a circle and Derek is part of that circle. Anyone who says he isn’t is an enemy. Just tell me who you want to meet and Derek and I will make the call for you.’ Draper himself expanded on this theme: ‘There are 17 people in this country who count, and to say that I am intimate with every one of them is the understatement of the century.’ Among the 17 people who counted was Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One motor racing billionaire. Before the election, Ecclestone, who had in the past supported the Tories, slipped the Labour Party a million pounds. Soon after the election, New Labour ratted on its firmest manifesto promise: to ban tobacco advertising. Any ban, it was announced, would not apply to the biggest tobacco advertisers: motor racing. When the media naturally connected this unexpected decision with the million-pound donation, a harassed Blair appeared on television to assure his audience that he was a ‘straight guy’ – and the million pounds was returned to the billionaire. At a stroke, within a few months of the election, Blair and his office secured a reputation for the ‘sleaze’ for which they had denounced the Tories. The reputation stuck with them. The master of communications Peter Mandelson had to resign twice from the Labour Cabinet – once when it emerged that he had, without telling anyone, borrowed £370,000 from a Cabinet colleague, Geoffrey Robinson, to buy a mansion, and the second time for intervening to inquire about a British passport for one of the billionaire Hinduja brothers, who were wanted in India for the most monstrous corruption involving an arms company. Such unfortunate episodes were almost inevitable considering the way in which New Labour ministers flung themselves at the feet of their benefactors in the City and elsewhere.

What was much more shocking was the systematic way in which the Blair Government set about dismantling the democratic traditions of their Party and their predecessors. Up to and including the general election campaign, Blair had mocked the Tory ‘quangos’, quasi-non-Government (and non-elected) organizations, taking control of the country’s industries and services. Gordon Brown, in his last Labour Party conference speech before the election, attacked what he called ‘the quango state that threatens democracy’. Within months of the election of his Government, however, a huge rash of non-elected ‘task forces’ had been established to supervise pretty well every industry and service in the country. These task forces were quangos in all but name. They provided positions of power and influence for all those businessmen who had guzzled at Labour’s tables. A survey of the first 3,000 people appointed to the task forces was carried out and published by Democratic Audit (an organization that had effectively exposed and denounced the Tory quangos) in 2000. Only 73 (2 per cent) of the task force members were trade unionists. More than a third (1,107) were from businesses, banks and trade associations, and most of the rest were spin doctors, consultants, bankers and special advisers.

A recognition of state-imposed social and infrastructural inequality wasn’t the only reason for the flow of funds into feminist groups in the early 1980s. One of the key sites of institutional opposition to Thatcher came from the leftward political shift of the Greater London Council (GLC). The GLC was an administrative government body that had been set up in 1965 to try and improve planning and spending decisions at a local level, through organising London and its surrounding regions into borough councils. The GLC was responsible for roads, public transport, housing and leisure services, and its overall purpose was to improve the well-being of Londoners, and to encourage social, economic and physical development. In 1981 the GLC elected Andrew McIntosh from the Labour Party as its leader, who was promptly replaced by Ken Livingstone after an internal leadership reshuffle. Livingstone’s leadership created great consternation for the governing Conservative Party, who were wary of Livingstone’s unequivocally socialist politics, and dubbed him ‘Red Ken’. Speaking at the Scottish Conservative Conference that year, Thatcher commented that the GLC would ‘impose upon this nation a tyranny which the peoples of Eastern Europe yearn to cast aside’.31 Livingstone’s GLC made its opposition of Thatcher’s government and the neoliberal Conservative status quo evident, slashing public transport costs under the ‘Fares Fair’ scheme (until the GLC was taken to court and forced to raise prices again); aligning itself with the international campaign for Wages for Housework; investing in nurseries, some of which we were co-operatively run; expressing its support for nuclear disarmament; promoting community-led arts and culture; championing LGBT rights, workplace democracy and community-controlled development; and funding organisations working on issues such as anti-racism and gender-based violence.32 The work of the GLC under Livingstone has been described as an ‘experiment’ in urban economic development; even detractors of the last years of the GLC recognise that it was expanding how city planning could operate and which demographics it would prioritise in its spending.33 Crucially for

In 1986, despite popularity among Londoners,62 the GLC was abolished by Thatcher’s Local Government Act, and the ‘shower’ of grant funding came to an end.63 It was the dissolution of the largest single funding source for women ever established in Britain.64 By the end of the 1980s, the funding landscape looked perhaps as barren as it had at the beginning of the decade.

Reflecting on materials produced by the Women’s Committee, now archived by the Glasgow Women’s Library, academic Lucy Brownson found that queer, disabled, migrant, working-class, Black women and women of colour were among those who ‘most acutely felt the fallout from the GLC’s abolition, and whose lives have been disproportionately affected by the rampant moralism and nationalism that Thatcher’s government enshrined in law’.65 Grant presciently noted in 2001 that ‘women’s organisations have never had such sympathetic and generous funders since.’

In 1991, rape perpetrated by a person against their husband or wife was made a criminal offence; in 1992 the first independent sexual violence advocate (IDVA) service was set up to support survivors in navigating legal proceedings; in 1996 the Family Law Act introduced restraining orders; and in 1997 the sex offenders’ register was set up, while in the same year the Protection from Harassment Act criminalised stalking. These acts of criminalisation represent attempts to concretise, quantify and contain gender-based violence through the pursuit, through the courts, of individual men for individual acts. The very genuine hope underscoring this work is that a retributive, after-the-fact exchange of gender-based violence for prison violence (and its own concomitant context of gender-based violence) will deliver us into a better future.

For women’s organisations, pitching anti-FGM/C programmes in ways that supported government agendas and narratives became a viable way for them to stay afloat, while organisations such as Imkaan placed clear emphasis on the decline in core funding for specialist organisations that accompanied efforts to criminalise forms of violence such as FGM/C and forced marriage. These organisations identified a shift in the locus of ‘justice’ against a backdrop of austerity, from community-based organisations who offered specialist and therapeutic knowledge and expertise to the wood-panelled rooms of law courts where a minute handful of ‘perpetrators’ would be, potentially, handed criminal sentences. In reality, prosecutions for these new ‘crimes’ were low: the first prison sentence handed out for FGM/C occurred in 2019, thirty-four years after it was first illegalised, and as of 2021, just four convictions for forced marriage had been made.14 Feminists were encouraged to look to the ‘symbolic’ power of criminalisation, which requires survivors to testify against their own families and caregivers, while at the same time starving funding from organisations supporting survivors.

It may be true that laws indicate to survivors that the state deems their painful experiences unacceptable. This can be incredibly affirming and important to those of us who have been disbelieved and had our experiences minimised, by parties that might include the state. At the same time, this symbolism fails to prevent these same acts being committed, while funnelling people into the criminal punishment system in order to achieve these ‘symbolic’ ends.

After individualising experiences of abuse, the Act then provides ‘remedies’ that are heavily weighted towards the criminal-legal system, using the issue of modern slavery as a way to push law, order and border agendas and to expand profit for private companies. Kenway recounted that ‘one of the things that comes up with people who are in trafficking situations, in forced-labour situations, is that they want to be working and earning a decent living, often sending remittances home … So “rescuing” them, extracting them, and putting them in [Home Office] housing is not a very intelligent approach.’ Furthermore, charities report that the vast majority of women going through the government system for identifying and triaging potential victims of trafficking for support – the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – are being housed in accommodation provided by three private companies (Serco, Mears Group and Clearspring Ready Homes) that are awarded hefty contracts to deliver very poor-quality housing while pouring dividends into the pockets of their shareholders.34 In these ways, the Modern Slavery Act reinforces the border regime rather than recognising the border as a site of harm that produces danger and exploitation.

The loudest voices in mainstream British feminism largely call for the implementation of the ‘Nordic model’, a legal framework that seeks to criminalise the purchase of sexual services. The Nordic model is currently used in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, France, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Canada, and is shown to be ineffective in ‘ending’ sex work, while also making conditions more dangerous for sex workers. Fewer clients (decreased ‘demand’) gives workers less choice over whom they work with and where they work, and means that clients rush negotiations and vetting as they are worried about being noticed by police. In essence, the Nordic model tips the balance of power further in favour of the clients, rather than the workers. Sex worker advocacy groups call instead for the ‘decriminalisation’ of sex work, ensuring that workers can access the same legal rights and protections as workers in other industries, thereby reducing the potential for exploitation.36

Police abolition can be an incredibly difficult idea to grapple with because it can activate personal experiences of trauma, and therefore we must be guided by the experiences of survivors of all forms of violence, including state violence. Those of us who advocate police abolition, many of us survivors, are understandably often asked to explain what we would ‘do’ with people whose actions might be considered objectively abhorrent: the rapists, the child abusers and the murderers. These forms of violence make up what I call the ‘carceral feminist triad’: three manifestations of abuse that are generally considered to be unacceptable in society, and that instil so much fear and pain that the mere suggestion of (what is sometimes imagined to be) further exposure to these types of violence can provoke strong responses. I codify the carceral feminist triad not by any means to suggest that these forms are indeed the ‘worst’ or most prevalent in a hierarchy of violence. In fact, the triad invisibilises widespread, coexistent and similarly fatal forms of racial and economic violence that also affect marginalised communities, such as poverty and environmental degradation. The carceral feminist triad instead points towards how the carceral system taps into collectively held and deeply emotional responses to these topics in particular, which are further amplified by the way in which these types of violence are sensationally and gratuitously represented in media and popular culture. It also acts as a cognitive ‘gotcha’ that is levied against those who advocate police abolition, suggesting that defunding and abolition are not viable given the unique threat that the carceral feminist triad of violence poses. The struggle for police abolition is steered by work to reduce all forms of violence and harm in society.

When those of us advocating abolition are asked what we would ‘do’ about the carceral feminist triad if police no longer existed, abolitionist Angel Parker provides a useful response to encourage this conversation forwards: ‘what are we doing with them now?’13 Right now, the police do not prevent rape. Even when rape is reported after the fact, only 1–2 per cent of rapes are prosecuted. This means that the promise of reporting rape as a way to prevent further harm to other people is not fulfilled by the police. Equally, right now, the police do not prevent murder, and nonetheless violent ‘crime’ has actually reduced by two-thirds since 1995 (a detail often obscured by statistics that show increased police recordings of ‘violent crime’ despite an overall much lower incidence).

Another justification posed for carceral responses to the carceral feminist triad is the contested idea that people who carry out repeated acts of manipulation and extreme violence that are accompanied by a lack of empathy or remorse, some of whom are diagnosed as having antisocial personality disorders (such as what was previously referred to in medical and legal settings as ‘psychopathy’), are understood as being immune to rehabilitation.16 From this position, the carceral logic follows that the only viable response to people diagnosed as having antisocial personality disorders (ASPD) who also perform violent acts of lawbreaking outside state agendas is policing and prisons. The pathologisation of behaviours that are grouped together in an ASPD diagnosis is heavily contested, and the existence of diagnostic frameworks does not constitute a fixed and immutable ‘knowing’ of a complex range of human experiences. As Micha Frazer-Carroll, author of Mad World, explained to me, ‘Our concepts of “illness” and “disorder” are not God-given categories – they are shaped by the social, political and economic expectations of our society. The concept of the “psychopath” or the “antisocial personality”, in particular, is a deeply political one, which often leads to very violent outcomes for people who receive this diagnosis.’

We know that policing tactics such as stop and search, raids and the gangs matrix do not prevent murder, rape and child abuse, and that police interventions in domestic violence situations often do not stop murders from happening. On this latter point, since 2011, statutory domestic homicide reviews (DHRs) have been carried out after any murder of a person aged over sixteen by an intimate partner, relative or household member. Analysis of DHRs gives us an indication of the demographics of people for whom the police fail to intervene and prevent murder in a domestic abuse context: recent data showed that the majority of victims (61 per cent) were vulnerabilised by a lack of support around alcohol and drug use, and also experienced mental health problems. Some 71 per cent of people who had murdered someone also experienced problems with alcohol and drug use as well as poor mental health. Some 60 per cent had a ‘previous offending history’ and 52 per cent were known to the police, indicating that prior criminal-legal interventions and contact with police had been ineffective in preventing the murder they later carried out.15 It’s evident that police do not prevent murder, and that even when people become known to the police for prior violent acts, in many cases police responses are not successful in preventing further, fatal forms of violence.

During research in the western Balkans and Turkey in 2017 alongside the activist and academic Neha Kagal, I met with a range of women’s organisations supporting marginalised survivors of violence (including Roma, Egyptian and Ashkali women; disabled women; LGBTQI people; and women living in rural areas), who explained that survivors have ‘a thousand ways to solve our problems’ without engaging with the police or the criminal-legal system. Instead of pushing for police reporting, these groups used community-based safety strategies such as hosting drop-in sessions where women could leave the family home and socialise, relax and heal, and opening their homes to each other if survivors intuited that it would be safer to be away from their family home for a period of time.36 Kagal’s research as a member of a waste picker’s union in India also indicated that union membership itself was a strategy through which women were able to reduce the harm of domestic violence. Through what union members described as an emboldened sense of self and entitlement to be in the marital home due to their material contributions to it, survivors transferred the skills they learnt in the union space into the domestic space, shifting from tactics of bargaining to making demands backed up by the threat of withdrawing their labour and earnings.37

The failure of the search for a convenient or easy solution to the problem of voters’ apathy suggests that the real reason for the low turn-outs and the convergence of the attitudes of political parties lies much deeper – in the very structure of society. The distinctive characteristic of our society is that it is split into classes. This is not merely an empirical fact, proved by the glaring differences between the rich and the rest. The concept of class runs deeper than the mere facts of inequality. The rich are not simply a small group of people who have struck lucky. Nor are they distinguished by the remarkable fact that they can pass on their riches to their children, whose inherited wealth has no connection whatever to their achievement. Pretty well all the wealth of the rich can be attributed in one way or another to exploitation of other people – either through rents or interest or dividends, wealth that accrues simply because it is there in the first place, or profit, which is the surplus value of an industrial or commercial enterprise. The rich know they are rich mainly through inheritance, exploitation, luck or trickery. They know they have no ‘right’ whatsoever to their wealth. They therefore cling together in a spirit of class solidarity and invent and legislate the ‘rights’ of property. They show intellectual and political solidarity with each other. The point of such solidarity is to keep rich, and the best way of keeping rich is to make sure that the barbarians at the gate, those who are not rich at all, are kept preferably out of sight, maybe at a distance but certainly under control.

Marx and Engels lumped all these agents of capitalism under the heading of ‘the state’, a notion substantially developed by the Marxists who led the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. In his book Imperialism and World Economy, published in 1915, Nikolai Bukharin, perhaps the most sensitive and articulate of the Bolshevik theorists, predicted that the ruling class was continually merging its previously feuding components into a single power, ‘the state’. The state, he argued, was beginning to behave more and more like ‘the executive committee of the ruling class’. The various components of the state – the police, the armed forces, the civil service, media, judiciary and so on – were not, as they pretended, ‘neutral’ between rich and poor. On the contrary, they were organizing themselves increasingly into ‘one solid reactionary mass’, less and less tolerant of ‘democratic and liberal arguments’. In this new situation, Bukharin predicted, parliaments would lose the purpose they used to have when different sections of the ruling class resolved their differences in parliamentary chambers: ‘Parliament at present serves as a decorative institution; it passes on decisions prepared beforehand in the businessmen’s organizations and gives only formal sanction to the collective will of the consolidated bourgeoisie as a whole.’

Internationally, the process was even more dramatic. The bureaucrats who put together the Treaty of Rome in 1956 as the foundation of a European Union were at best uninterested and at worst downright hostile to extending democracy. The affairs of the new Union were blithely put in the charge of an appointed Commission, with a huge supporting bureaucracy far out of the reach of any electorate. When a European Parliament was grudgingly conceded much later, the powers of its elected Members were crudely subordinated to those of the unelected Commission. The MEPs’ power and authority went down almost as fast as their salaries and expenses went up. The European Parliament is still, in effect, subservient to the unelected Commission. One result of this undemocratic structure was an almost continual Euro-corruption on a scale far more revolting even than anything that took place in the member states. Similarly, the international bodies that determine the standards and texture of life all over the world are all deeply undemocratic. The United Nations is controlled not by the nations of the world but by a cabal of Governments of rich and powerful nations called the Security Council. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which lay down the economic laws by which many hundreds of millions of poor people starve to death, are elected by, and democratically responsible to, no one. The World Trade Organization seeks all the time to interfere with and dictate to elected Governments, instructing them, for instance, to uphold the sacred principle of competition, even where that competition leads directly to greater exploitation, greater sickness and greater poverty. Everywhere the grim predictions of Bukharin and Lenin are being vindicated. Popular democracy is out. Capitalist bureaucracy is in.

Common to all this resistance has been a yearning for a new democracy. Often this yearning showed itself in a more practical form: a form based on the notion of electing representatives at the place of work. Inside the outer shell of the trade-union movements, for instance, in which officials, though sometimes elected, are mostly appointed and, as a result, much less responsive, there are hundreds of elections of shop stewards who are not paid extra for their work and who owe their positions to their constant accessibility to the people who elect them. This concept of elected officials representing workers has a long history that bursts into life in times of revolution. The distinguishing feature of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917 was the formation of soviets, workers’ councils, voted in and answerable to groups of workers according to their numbers. The central characteristic of the period between the two Russian Revolutions of 1917 was the growth of soviets alongside the growth of parliamentary parties. There was a struggle for supremacy between the two, a struggle that developed with breathtaking speed into a struggle for state power. Without that struggle in the soviets, and the victory in them of the revolutionary party (Bolsheviks) against the parliamentary parties, the second Russian Revolution of 1917 would never have taken place. The survival of that Revolution depended on the democracy thrown up by the soviets, and when most of the workers in the industrial soviets were effectively destroyed in the civil war and counter-revolution that followed, the Russian Revolution perished.

Parliamentary democracy is, in truth, little more than a means for securing a periodical change in the management team, which is then allowed to preside over a system that remains in essence intact. If the British people were ever to ask themselves what power they truly enjoyed under our present political system they would be amazed to discover how little it is, and some new Chartist agitation might be born and might quickly gather momentum.

This book has explored the seductive possibility that a new egalitarian and democratic world society can be created bit by bit through institutions established and tolerated by the society it seeks to replace. The abject failure of that project in the country where it was first advanced, Britain, is now plain for all to see. Revolution from above is nonsense.

Such a struggle is not one cataclysmic heave. It shows itself in a million different forms, from great outbursts of revolt to tiny gestures of resistance. The job of socialists and democrats, instead of seeking to cure those problems from above, is to identify with and take part in the struggles from below and link them together. This does not mean that Parliament and elections to it can be ignored. It does mean, however, that the main job of socialists is to relegate Parliament to the sidelines it has chosen for itself and to concentrate on politics where it matters, among and on behalf of the dispossessed. Above all, this requires, more than ever before, the coordination of socialists and revolutionaries in an organization dedicated and resolved enough to confront the organized capitalist state with the only force capable of defeating it, the organized working-class movement, and of forging the huge disparate mass of opposition into a combined revolutionary unit.

Nixonger’s primary goal was accomplished the moment that Allende was removed from power: Chile’s democratic road to socialism no longer threatened to generate a systemic alternative to capitalism in the region.

Quoting Kant’s famous categorical imperative to treat people always as ends and never as means, Kissinger added an addendum: “what one considers an end, and what one considers a mean, depends essentially on the metaphysics of one’s system, and on the concept one has of one’s self and one’s relationship to the universe.”3 In other words, Kissinger early on declared himself in favor of what the modern New Right has denounced, until recently at least, as radical relativism: there is no such thing as absolute truth, he argued in his early writings, no truth at all other than what could be deduced from one’s own solitary perspective.

It is the moment when the “causality men” (Spengler’s term) and the “fact men” (Kissinger’s term) take over that a civilization is in most danger. As the dreams, myths and risk-taking of an earlier creative period fall away, intellectuals and political leaders become predominantly concerned with questioning not why, but how. “A century of purely extensive effectiveness,” Spengler writes, referring to the bureaucratic rationalism of modern society, which strives for ever more efficient ways of doing things, “is a time of decline.” The intuitive dimensions of wisdom get tossed aside, technocratic procedure overwhelms purpose, and information is mistaken for wisdom.

Salvador Allende was the antithetical embodiment of Henry Kissinger’s Latin America policy. Three years before Kissinger assumed a leading role in foreign policy, Allende had warned of the problems a left government in the region might face. In 1966, the future president of Chile gave an almost prophetic warning, laying out how the Latin American left viewed US foreign policy: The Johnson Doctrine constitutes for the Chilean people, as for all the countries of Latin America, an explicit declaration that imperialists will respond with violence to any popular movement that has any chance of coming into power. This has made the Chilean popular movement—which has achieved notable gains expanding and deepening democracy in our country—clearly realize that the United States will use force to prevent it from accessing power by democratic and legal means. It also means that, consequently, we have an obligation to intensify our struggle; mobilize the masses, link anti-imperialist actions to the everyday demands of the population: strikes, land occupations, collective mobilizations, and the awareness that we will meet with opposition from reactionary violence and we will oppose it with revolutionary violence. It will be the people of Chile and our country’s conditions that will determine what method we use to defeat the imperialist enemy and its allies.

The CIA now conspired to sabotage the impending inauguration extralegally by instigating a coup. The aim was to overturn normal legal procedures by creating an atmosphere of fear and panic. Unable to find capable collaborators, the Santiago station left planning in the hands of fringe officials, without solid ties to business or to leading military sections. Their botched kidnapping ended up killing the constitutionalist commander-in-chief, René Schneider Chereau, bloodying Santiago’s streets. For the moment, the “firm and continuous” commitment to topple Allende receded from view.

The Pike Committee noted the covert action took place in a “setting of almost unprecedented secrecy within the US government,” which it believed was intended to keep the State Department—which had opposed such measures in the past—from learning of it.4 To create plausible deniability, the United States and Israel supplied the Kurds only with captured Soviet arms. The founder of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Mustafa Barzani, had no faith in the shah and recognized that his people were being used as pawns in Iran’s ambitions against Iraq. Yet he had full faith in the United States: “America is too great a power to betray a small people like the Kurds,” he said.5 But, according to the Pike Committee, “Dr. Kissinger and the foreign head of state [the Shah] hoped our clients [Barzani] would not prevail…” Although Kissinger encouraged hostilities, the US government would at one point restrain the Kurds from an all-out offensive they feared would have succeeded.6 A Kurdish victory in Iraq would have had intolerable effects on American interests. Kissinger only wanted to arm the Kurds enough to menace the Iraqi government, not enough that they would achieve any real success. So when the United States and Iran warmed to Iraq, they had no qualms about abandoning the Kurds.

After the United Kingdom created the modern state of Iraq, they installed a puppet monarch to maintain Western (that is, British) access to Iraqi oil. In 1958, however, a coup displaced the monarchy, and Abd al-Karim Qasim came to power. He declared Iraq neutral in the Cold War, withdrawing from an anti-communist military alliance that included Iran and kicking British military bases out of the country. This development upset CIA chief Allen Dulles, who warned Dwight Eisenhower that the coup could set off a domino effect and remove the Americans’ preferred regimes across the entire Middle East. Fearing the spread of anti-Western sentiment, Eisenhower intervened in Lebanon that same year.

When war erupted in South Asia in 1971, President Nixon and his national security advisor expressed their displeasure with the way the Indian government was acting. While discussing the war with Kissinger one day, the president fumed, “The Indians need … what they really need is a—” Kissinger chimed in: “They’re such bastards.” But the president was not done speaking. He completed his thought: “What they really need is a mass famine.”1 President Nixon seemed to dislike India. He once said, “I don’t know why the hell anybody would reproduce in that damn country but they do.”2 But on this occasion he had a special reason to be resentful toward the country—India was supporting the nationalists in East Pakistan, who were fighting for their independence against West Pakistan, a US ally. Ultimately, the war would lead to the birth of a new sovereign state, Bangladesh, an outcome Nixon and Kissinger tried to prevent. The conflict had other consequences as well. While independent researchers have estimated that between 300,000 and 500,000 were killed in East Pakistan, Bangladesh officially claims that West Pakistan’s military and East Pakistan’s local militia killed about three million people and raped 200,000 women.3 Additionally, some 10 million refugees fled the conflict in East Pakistan to go to India.4 Despite the loss of human lives, Kissinger ensured throughout the conflict that the United States supported West Pakistan’s leadership in its mission to violently suppress the resistance.5

The committee awarding the prize had been chaired by none other than Henry Kissinger. At the last minute, though, Kissinger canceled his presence at the award ceremony and his speech was read by the vice president of the jury. In the speech, Kissinger commended the East Timorese resistance for struggling “amidst nations following imperatives they considered more immediate” than Timorese independence, and succeeding “against all odds—against overwhelming military power, against indifference abroad.” Which nations followed other imperatives, and which had been indifferent, the former secretary of state did not specify. “Americans,” Kissinger wrote, “can take pride in the role their country has played in the ultimate culmination of these events.”

But beyond padding Kissinger’s personal portfolio, his consulting work was crucial in spreading the advance of neoliberal economic policy around the globe. The auspicious beginnings of Kissinger Associates in 1982, a year of serious global financial crisis—and therefore opportunity for capitalist interests—demonstrate just how implicated Henry Kissinger was in advancing this new set of economic priorities. After the Mexican government announced in August of 1982 that it would be unable to make payments on its outstanding foreign debt, and some forty other countries followed suit and announced their own defaults, there were widespread fears of a systemic collapse of the financial sector. In response, the IMF and the US government devised rescue packages that would restructure the commercial debt of countries like Mexico. Much of this debt was owed to the largest banks in the United States, such as Chase Manhattan, JP Morgan, Citicorp and American Express—many of which were clients of Kissinger Associates. In addition to advising these firms directly during the debt crisis, Kissinger used his public platform, including newspaper columns and interviews on major news networks, to advocate for debt relief structures that would be particularly advantageous for his clients. He argued, for example, that the banks themselves shouldn’t have to shoulder the full weight of the defaults; rather, the governments of the United States and the other creditor nations should have to carry some of the burden of restructuring. This was a classic tenet of neoliberal policy: privatize the profits, but socialize the risk. Throughout the 1980s, Kissinger advocated it loudly in the media without disclosing his financial ties to firms that would profit from such a strategy.

the client list for the firm remains a closely guarded secret. The question of just who were the former secretary’s associates surged into the spotlight when George W. Bush named Kissinger the chair of the independent commission created to investigate the September 11 terrorist attacks. Congressional Democrats insisted that to prove there were no conflicts of interest, he had to disclose the client list for Kissinger Associates; he resigned the post rather than do so. Despite this secrecy, however, the firm has publicly entered into a number of “strategic partnerships” in recent years. These include links with some of the country’s biggest financial firms, including, since 2002, AIG and the Blackstone Group, the private equity house run by Pete Peterson, who had been secretary of commerce under Nixon.3 This followed the announcement in 2000 of a partnership with Hakluyt & Company, a management consultancy created and run by former spies with the British intelligence agency MI6.4 Hakluyt has been implicated in spying on environmental activist groups such as Greenpeace on behalf of clients like Royal Dutch Shell and British Petroleum.5 Perhaps because of the scrutiny that Kissinger Associates and strategic partners like Hakluyt experienced following the uproar over the 9/11 Commission, Kissinger partnered in 2004 with the public relations firm APCO Worldwide, which handles PR for clients involved in sensitive political or reputational crises.6 Around the same time, Kissinger also announced a partnership with the DC-based corporate law firm Covington & Burling, which has represented clients such as Philip Morris, Halliburton, Chiquita and Blackwater (Xe).7 To best serve corporate clients, then, Kissinger Associates is now partnered with some of the world’s biggest and most important investing, insurance, intelligence, PR and law firms.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Kissinger Associates has been closely tied to more recent geopolitical and economic crises, as well. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the 2008 financial crisis, Kissinger Associates snapped up Lehman’s former head of sovereign risk, Jami Miscik, and installed her as president and vice chair. But it wasn’t just her background at Lehman that made her Kissinger material. Prior to her time at the failed investment firm, Miscik spent more than two decades in intelligence, culminating in her appointment as the CIA’s deputy director of intelligence from 2002 to 2005—during which time she was responsible for the intelligence with which the Bush administration made the case for the war in Iraq.8 These, it should be noted, were not ordinary stints in government and finance: they were positions in two of the most disastrous episodes in recent geopolitical and economic history. But where others saw crisis and challenge, Kissinger demonstrated that he saw opportunity, installing Miscik to sit at the nexus between government and finance that is Kissinger Associates.

Summer House is prototypical of this modern, asset-manager-ruled world in at least three crucial respects, each to be explored in detail in the chapters that follow. First, asset managers are relentless in squeezing maximum profits out of the homes and infrastructures they own. They cut to the bone the costs incurred in operating those assets – which is obviously less than ideal if you happen to live in one of those assets. And they do whatever they need to do to maximise the incomes (such as rents) that the assets generate. If mass eviction is what it takes, then, à la Fifteen Group, mass eviction is what it will be. Second, asset managers both buy and sell housing and infrastructure assets. It is difficult to overemphasise the significance of the latter activity. Selling is as much a part of the business model as owning. In fact, one might say that asset managers buy such assets generally in order to sell them; and the fact that ownership is a mere means to that end has all manner of deleterious consequences – all too visible in the case of Summer House – during the period of proprietorship. At nine and seven years, respectively, Fifteen Group and Kennedy Wilson’s periods of ownership of Summer House were actually on the long side by asset managers’ standards. On average, ownership is shorter than that. Blackstone, as far as one can discover, still owns Summer House five years on from purchasing it. But for how much longer? Third, asset-manager society is in significant measure invisible. Partly, this is because much of the buying and selling occurs in private, with limited, if any, requirement for disclosure: as we have seen, Kennedy Wilson did not say who it sold Summer House to on either occasion that it did so. But the invisibility also pertains partly to actual asset operation. Whether it is a toll road, a school, a gas pipeline or an apartment block (such as Summer House), the asset manager that owns it almost never manages it, and hence evades scrutiny for this reason, too. ‘We’re in the business of owning the backbone of the global economy. [But] what we do is behind the scenes. Nobody knows we’re there’, the CEO of Brookfield Asset Management, one of the world’s leading asset managers in the housing and infrastructure space, has observed, ‘and we provide critical infrastructure to people that somebody pays a small amount for … the road you drive on, most people think it’s owned by the government. Even if it is a toll road, they wouldn’t actually know who owned it’.21 This book’s aim is to ensure that people do know – and know why it matters.

But, even if it complicates the picture, it is important nonetheless to recognise that some of the world’s biggest and most influential asset managers – including in the real assets space – are indeed companies whose core business is the provision of insurance and reinsurance services. The prime example is Germany’s Allianz Group, founded as long ago as 1890, and frequently identified today as the world’s largest insurance firm. Not only does Allianz mostly not rely on third-party asset managers to invest its own considerable capital, instead carrying out that investment in-house, but, through its twin asset-management businesses, PIMCO and Allianz Global Investors, it also manages and invests huge sums of external capital, these third-party AUM having grown to no less than €2 trillion by the end of 2021.7

More importantly still, asset-manager capitalism’s ‘Big Three’ do not even want control of the companies in which they hold their thousands of minority positions. Control is not part of the business model. As Benjamin Braun has persuasively argued, the hallmark of asset-manager capitalism is precisely asset-manager passivity. It is a capitalism of large, universal and ‘disinterested’ shareholders.20

Several features of this fully outsourced model of asset operation are noteworthy. One relates to the implied nature of the asset manager’s own business. Consider BlackRock and Tellenes. Given that all operational elements are contracted out, Black-Rock in this instance is neither an energy company itself nor even an investor in an energy company. Its investment is solely and specifically in a physical asset, and its business is maximising and extracting the income – rent – that that asset generates. It is, therefore, a pure rentier. The same is true of Aberdeen Standard Investments in the Carlsbad case and MIRA in the toll-road case.

Relatedly, there is the question of the nature of the business of the companies that handle operations for the likes of Black-Rock and Aberdeen. Again, consider Tellenes, and Arise AB. As it happens, Arise currently operates ten of its own wind farms (as well as the fourteen that are third-party-owned), and in those ten cases it is acting in the capacity of an energy company as we conventionally understand the concept – that is, a company generating and supplying power to one or more customer. But, at Tellenes, it is not. It is not an energy company, but a service provider: its customer is BlackRock, and BlackRock does not buy power from it. Similarly, Aberdeen buys services, not water, from Poseidon. In other words, these cases entail a fundamental reconfiguration of business models and relationships. There is no energy company or water company as such. There are rentier-owners on the one hand, and there are providers of services to those rentier-owners on the other.

A final noteworthy feature of the outsourcing-based rentier model is one that we return to in more depth in Chapter 4. Specifically: the asset manager’s profits clearly increase to the extent that it can limit the amount it pays those who clean its apartments, sit in its tollbooths and patrol its parking lots. This is one of the costs of asset-manager society.

In any event, if management fees in infrastructure and real-estate asset management are modelled on private equity, so also is the second fee type: performance fees. The better the fund performs for its limited partners, the more those partners pay the general partner – which is to say, the asset manager. Again, performance fees are anything but standardised, but there is more uniformity across the market on these than there is on management fees. The most common performance fee is so-called ‘carried interest’ (or simply ‘carry’), which is a form of profit share paid on the basis of any gains realised through asset disposal. Often, carry is only paid if the fund achieves a certain level of financial return for its limited partners, referred to as the ‘hurdle rate’, and typically set at around 8 per cent, annualised. If the hurdle rate is met, the general partner takes a cut – usually 20 per cent – of all realised fund returns. Management and performance fees paid by a fund’s limited partners thus represent the principal income streams for real-asset asset managers. As in the overlapping world of private equity (and indeed hedge-fund investment), it is common to hear the two sets of fees combined referred to with the moniker ‘two and twenty’ – that is, a 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent performance fee. But, as we have seen, there is considerable variance around this norm. What bears emphasising is that the effect of these combined fees is obviously to generate for the asset manager a share of fund proceeds significantly exceeding the share of capital it commits to the fund in the first place.

These additional fees are far from immaterial: analysing approximately 600 fund-based US buyouts (albeit not just of infrastructure or real-estate companies), Ludovic Phalippou and colleagues calculated that transaction and monitoring fees combined were equivalent to over 6 per cent of the value of the total equity invested.36 Insofar as a fund’s limited partners (LPs) are the main shareholders in a fund’s portfolio companies (remember that the general partner usually commits only 1–5 per cent of fund capital), it is accordingly they who bear the burden of such costs. In the face of significant criticism, some asset managers have shown increasing willingness to share that burden – for instance by offsetting a proportion of transaction and monitoring fees against the management fees paid by LPs – but not always, and usually only to a limited degree.

In 2005, the UK firm Terra Firma Capital Partners, led by the renowned financier Guy Hands, achieved what at the time was the largest ever buyout of a residential real-estate company by an asset manager. One of its funds acquired Viterra, the property subsidiary of the German utility E.ON, which owned and let 150,000 apartments across Germany. The deal valued Viterra and its physical assets at over €7 billion.37 But the Terra Firma fund did not itself invest €7 billion. For one thing, Viterra came with €1.25 billion of existing debt. More importantly, of the €6 billion that E.ON received for the sale, only €1 billion in fact came from Terra Firma and its limited partners in the investment fund. So where did the other €5 billion come from? The answer will be obvious to anybody familiar with the business of real-estate or infrastructure (or indeed private equity) asset management. The other €5 billion was borrowed – specifically, from a group of banks including Citigroup, Barclays, Hypovereinsbank, Eurohypo, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale. In the vernacular of finance, the deal was highly leveraged or geared. Terra Firma’s own capital commitment to the fund that acquired Viterra was not disclosed, but if we assume for the sake of argument that 3 per cent – €30 million – of the €1 billion of equity invested was the general partner’s (this being the industry average), then Terra Firma’s equity contribution as a proportion of Viterra’s enterprise value of €7 billion or more would have been less than 0.5 per cent.

Crucially, when investing with leverage in infrastructure or housing, it is not the investment fund itself that borrows money and subsequently shoulders the debt. Rather, the debt goes onto the balance sheet either of the company that the fund has acquired or – as for example in the case of the acquisition not of a company but of a physical asset such as an apartment block or wind farm – of a holding company established by the asset manager to hold the acquired asset. Furthermore, it is usually so-called non-recourse debt, meaning that creditors only ever have a potential claim specifically on those assets against which the debt is collateralised.

Needless to say, given asset managers’ use of large amounts of debt to finance their purchases of real assets, anything that can be done to reduce the cost of that debt also helps to boost returns – which is where more complex methods of financial engineering enter the picture. Philip Ashton and colleagues have noted, for example, that the consortium that purchased both the Chicago Skyway and Indiana Toll Road concessions in 2005 and 2006, respectively – namely, a partnership between Macquarie’s American infrastructure fund and the Spanish transportation-infrastructure developer Cintra – used interest rate swaps to this end.43 Similarly, while it was under the ownership and control of Blackstone funds, Invitation Homes used securitisation techniques to lower the cost of the debt that it raised to finance its single-family-housing acquisition spree. Specifically, it issued bonds backed by future flows of rental income from those homes. Approximately 75 per cent of the $10 billion or so that Invitation Homes invested in housing prior to its 2017 stock-market listing was raised with debt, and more than two-thirds of that debt was securitised debt rather than simple loans. The securitised debt was cheaper: the coupons (interest rates) on the rental-backed bonds ranged from 2.21 to 2.89 per cent; interest rates on the loans advanced to Invitation Homes ranged from 3.03 to 3.54 per cent.44 When borrowing billions of dollars, that is a huge cost differential.

Two main methods are used, although they amount to more or less the same thing. The first is so-called dividend recapitalisation. Imagine, in the hypothetical case outlined above featured in Blackstone’s listing prospectus, that operating cash-flow has been used to pay down $300 million of the original $700 million of debt. In such a scenario, the portfolio company could then borrow a further amount – say, $200 million – of which some or all could be used to pay its shareholders a special dividend. This is dividend recapitalisation: essentially a way for equity investors to realise value from an investment without selling it. With infrastructure and real-estate assets often generating strong, predictable cash-flows, dividend ‘recaps’ are common in the real-assets investment world. In 2020, for example, Empark, a leading car-park concessionaire with over 500,000 parking spaces in the Iberian Peninsula, Britain and Turkey, issued €575 million of new bonds. About €92 million of the capital thus raised reportedly went towards paying a dividend to Empark’s owner, the Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 5.

I shall have more to say about shareholder loans in Chapter 6. The critical point here is that the interest payments that such loans generate during the life of an investment are equivalent to dividends. A notable recent case of the large-scale use of shareholder loans in the real-assets space is the UK’s Thames Tideway Tunnel, which is owned, as we have seen, by a consortium of four asset managers. Collectively, the four shareholders invested approximately £1.3 billion in the project in 2015.

Of course, interest payments must somehow be funded, and in the Tideway case they have been paid for by pre-emptive increases in household water bills.47

One reason for overlooking this vital fact is that we are estranged from reality and inclined to treat as valueless everything that we have not made ourselves. Even the great Dr Marx fell into this devastating error when he formulated the so-called 'labour theory of value'. Now, we have indeed laboured to make some of the capital which today helps us to produce - a large fund of scientific, technological, and other knowledge; an elaborate physical infrastructure; innumerable types of sophisticated capital equipment, etc. - but all this is but a small part of the total capital we are using. Far larger is the capital provided by nature and not by man - and we do not even recognise it as such. This larger part is now being used up at an alarming rate, and that is why it is an absurd and suicidal error to believe, and act on the belief, that the problem of production has been solved.

Suppose it becomes the acknowledged purpose of inventors and engineers, observed Aldous Huxley, to provide ordinary people with the means of 'doing profitable and intrinsically significant work, of helping men and women to achieve independence from bosses, so that they may become their own employers, or members of a self-governing, co-operative group working for subsistence and a local market ... this differently orientated technological progress (would result in) a progressive decentralisation of population, of accessibility of land, of ownership of the means of production, of political and economic power'. Other advantages, said Huxley, would be 'a more humanly satisfying life for more people, a greater measure of genuine self-governing democracy and a blessed freedom from the silly or pernicious adult education provided by the mass producers of consumer goods through the medium of advertisements'.'

No. 1 am asking what ii means, what sort of meaning the method of economics actually produces. And the answer to this question cannot be in doubt: something is uneconomic when it fails to earn an adequate profit in terms of money. The method of economics does not, and cannot, produce any other meaning. Numerous attempts have been made to obscure this fact, and they have caused a very great deal of confusion: but the fact remains. Society, or a group or an individual within society, may decide to hang on to an activity or asset for non-economic reasons - social, aesthetic, moral, or political - but this does in no way alter its uneconomic character. The judgment of economics, in other words, is an extremely fragmentary judgment: out of the large number of aspects which in real life have to be seen and judged together before a decision can be taken, economics supplies only one - whether a thing yields a money profit to those who undertake it or not.

In competition, one might think, with the Marxist interpretation of all higher manifestations of human life, there is, fourthly, the Freudian interpretation which reduces them to the dark stirrings of a subconscious mind and explains them mainly as the results of unfulfilled incest-wishes during child- hood and early adolescence.

Mind and heart are at war with one another, nor as is commonly asserted, reason and faith. Our reason has become beclouded by an extraordinary, blind and unreasonable faith in a set of fantastic and life-destroying ideas inherited from the nineteenth century. It is the foremost task of our reason to recover a truer faith than that, Education cannot help us as long as it accords no place to meta- physics.

Nothing could be clearer. If agriculture does not pay, it is just a 'declining enterprise'. Why prop it up? There are no 'necessary improvements' as regards the land, but only as regards farmers' incomes, and these can be made if there are fewer farmers. This is the philosophy of the townsman. alienated from living nature, who promotes his own scale of priorities by arguing in economic terms that we cannot 'afford' any other. In fact, any society can afford to look after its land and keep it healthy and beautiful in perpetuity. There are no technical difficulties and there is no lack of relevant knowledge. There is no need to consult economic experts when the question is one of priorities. We know too much about ecology today to have any excuse for the many abuses that are currently going on in the management of the land, in the management of animals, in food storage, food processing, and in heedless urbanisation. If we permit them, this is not due to poverty, as if we could not afford to stop them; it is due to the fact that, as a society, we have no firm basis of belief in any meta-economic values, and when there is no such belief the economic calculus takes over. This is quite inevitable. How could it be otherwise? Nature, it has been said, abhors a vacuum, and when the avail- able 'spiritual space' is not filled by some higher motivation, then it will necessarily be filled by something lower - by the small, mean, calculating attitude to life which is rationalised in the economic calculus. I have no doubt that a callous attitude to the land and to the animals thereon is connected with, and symptomatic of, a great many other attitudes, such as those producing a fanaticism of rapid change and a fascination with novelties- technical, organisational, chemical, biological, and so forth - which insists on their application long before their long-term consequences are even remotely understood. In the simple question of how we treat the land, next to people our most precious resource, our entire way of life is involved, and before our policies with regard to the land will really be changed, there will have to be a great deal of philosophical, not to say religious, change. It is not a question of what we can afford but of what we choose to spend our money on. If we could return to a generous recognition of meta-economic values, our landscapes would become healthy and beautiful again and our people would regain the dignity of man, who knows himself as higher than the animal but never forgets that noblesse oblige.

Feminists are judged as threatening (of happiness) because we threaten what is deemed by some to be necessary (for happiness): a belief, a practice, a way of life, a social arrangement.

For some commentators, the use of trigger warnings is evidence of an oversensitive generation that shuts down whatever causes distress. In fact, trigger warnings are better understood as techniques that can enable some people to remain in the room in order to have difficult conversations about distressing material. Trigger warnings are about providing more information, not less. They are not about putting an end to difficult conversations but rather enabling those with a history of trauma to participate in them.

Thus, the taxi drivers of Paris have, when they were frustrated with the municipal authorities over fees or new regulations, resorted to what is known as a grève de zèle. They would all, by agreement and on cue, suddenly begin to follow all the regulations in the code routier, and, as intended, this would bring traffic in Paris to a grinding halt. Knowing that traffic circulated in Paris only by a practiced and judicious disregard of many regulations, they could, merely by following the rules meticulously, bring it to a standstill. The English-language version of this procedure is often known as the “work-to-rule” strike. In an extended work-to-rule action against the Caterpillar Corporation, workers reverted to following the inefficient procedures specified by engineers, knowing that it would cost the company valuable time and quality, rather than continuing the more expeditious practices they had long ago devised on the job. The actual work process in any office, on any construction site, or on any factory floor cannot be adequately explained by the rules, however elaborate, governing it; the work gets done only because of the effective informal understandings and improvisations outside those rules.

The planned economies of the socialist bloc before the breach in the Berlin Wall in 1989 were a striking example of how rigid production norms were sustained only by informal arrangements wholly outside the official scheme. In one typical East German factory, the two most indispensable employees were not even part of the official organizational chart. One was a “jack-of-all trades” adept at devising short-term, jury-rigged solutions to keep machines running, to correct production flaws, and to make substitute spare parts. The second indispensable employee used factory funds to purchase and store desirable nonperishable goods (e.g., soap powder, quality paper, good wine, yarn, medicines, fashionable clothes) when they were available. Then, when the factory absolutely needed a machine, spare parts, or raw material not available through the plan to meet its quotas and earn its bonuses, this employee packed the hoarded goods in a Trabant and went seeking to barter them for the necessary factory supplies. Were it not for these informal arrangements, formal production would have ceased.

The example of play invoked earlier may seem trivial by comparison with war and death. After all, play has no purpose at all beyond the pleasure and enjoyment of play itself. It is successful, even efficient, to the degree to which those who are playing judge it to be more fun than other things they might be doing. And yet play is deeply instructive, for it turns out that open, unstructured play of this kind, looked at broadly, is serious business indeed.

Universal public education is, of course, designed to do far more than merely turn out the labor force required by industry. It is as much a political as an economic institution. It is designed to produce a patriotic citizen whose loyalty to the nation will trump regional and local identities of language, ethnicity, and religion. The universal citizenship of revolutionary France had its counterpart in universal conscription. Manufacturing such patriotic citizens through the school system was accomplished less through the manifest curriculum than through its language of instruction, its standardization, and its implicit lessons in regimentation, authority, and order.

Because they are cooperative and give no trouble, such institutional subjects may be seen by those in charge in a favorable light, as they adapt well to institutional routines. In the severest cases they may become childish and affect a characteristic posture and gait (in the Nazi concentration camps, such prisoners, near death from privation, were called by other prisoners “Musselmänner”) and become withdrawn and inaccessible. These are institutional effects produced by the loss of contact with the outside world, the loss of friends and possessions, and the nature of the staff’s power over them.

The Sewell Report that followed argued not only that there was no evidence of institutional racism in the UK, but that “the success of much of the ethnic minority population in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, should be regarded as a model for other White-majority countries.” The report locates racism in the past, as well as in the minds of those it suggests have held on to the past: “For some groups, historic experience of racism still haunts the present and there was a reluctance to acknowledge that the UK had become open and fairer.” The report implies that racism only exists in the minds and memories of those who are haunted by history, not as what stops some groups from participating but as how some groups stop themselves from participating. Being positive is treated as objective and neutral and forward-thinking; being negative as subjective and biased and stuck in the past. As killjoy critics, we have learned to read the distribution of positives and negatives. The report uses them to describe the attitudes that determine outcomes not only for individuals but for different ethnic groups: “Those groups, particularly Indian and Chinese ethnic groups, who have the most success in British society tend to see fewer obstacles and less prejudice. And those groups that do less well, Black people and Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims, tend to see and experience more of both, though Black African people are considerably more positive than Black Caribbean people.” The report even tries to “see the positives” in slavery: “Here is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African/Britain.”30 Yes, even the transatlantic slave trade, which caused the death and dispossession of millions of African people, can be turned into a positive story of self-empowerment.

You can see why it is important to refuse to join some tables, to enter into debates where you are the question or the topic of conversation. I think back to the fact that when tables are used as examples within philosophy, they disappear. When you are asked to debate your existence around a table, you are asked to witness yourself disappear. In her aptly named article “When Tables Speak,” trans feminist philosopher Talia Mae Bettcher suggests that the problem of how tables appear and disappear in philosophy can be related to how philosophy has dealt with social and political issues. She notes, “I’m afraid there’s a tendency among some philosophers to suppose that philosophical investigations into race, gender, disability, trans issues, and so forth are no different methodologically from investigations into the question whether tables really exist.”9 When some of us enter a philosophical conversation about “race, gender, disability, trans issues,” it is akin to the tables speaking. When we embody the issue, we cannot abstract it from our lives or our activism.

Some might view the institution as open because it was open to them. That view of the organization, I would add, corresponds to and is confirmed by the official view: the door is open; anyone can enter. Openness can then be assumed to be a quality of a thing rather than a relation to it. It is not just that some do not need to notice doors. They might be invested in not noticing doors. To be invested in not noticing doors is about protecting a relation to an institution.

The direct translation of the French “petite” into English as “petty” rather than, say, “small” does further damage. Now it seems not just to mean small but also contemptibly trivial, as in “pettifoggery,” “petty cash,” and just plain “petty.” And when it is compounded into “petty-bourgeoisie,” it joins the contempt of Marxists, the intelligentsia, and the aristocracy for the philistine tastes and crass concern for money and property of the nouveau arrivé. After the Bolshevik Revolution a petty bourgeoisie label could mean prison, exile, or death. The contempt for the petty bourgeoisie was joined to the germ theory of disease in terms foreshadowing Nazi anti-Semitism. Bukharin, stigmatizing the striking workers and sailors, at Kronstadt noted that “the petty bourgeois infection had spread from the peasantry to a segment of the working class.”2 Those small peasants who resisted collectivization were castigated in similar terms: “the real danger of bourgeois miasma and petty bourgeois bacilli still remains—disinfection is necessary.”

There were comments on the weather or on a recent traffic accident nearby, inquiries after mutual friends and relatives, mentions of births in the neighborhood, questions on how a son or daughter was getting on, reflections on the annoying traffic noise, and so on. One could say the conversations were shallow and filled with little more than pleasantries, the small change of daily life, but they were never anonymous; the discussants knew one another’s name and a fair amount of each other’s family history. I was forcibly struck by the easy if thin sociability that prevailed and came to realize that these rounds were the social highlight of my friend’s parents’ day. They could easily have done most of their shopping more efficiently at a larger store no farther away. On a moment’s reflection, one sees that the shopkeepers are unpaid social workers, providing brief but amiable companionship to their steady clientele. “Unpaid” is, of course, not quite right, inasmuch as their prices were surely higher than at the larger outlets; the shopkeepers understood implicitly that the smiles and pleasantries they offered were one way in which they built up a steady and loyal clientele and hence their business. Lest we become overly cynical about the mask of shopkeeper smiles, however, it is worth noting that such pleasantries may well also take the hard edge off a day otherwise spent behind a counter cutting, weighing, and counting money.

The seductiveness of such measures is that they all turn measures of quality into measures of quantity, thereby allowing comparison across cases with an apparently single and impersonal metric. They are above all a vast and deceptive “antipolitics machine” designed to turn legitimate political questions into neutral, objective administrative exercises governed by experts. It is this depoliticizing sleight-of-hand that masks a deep lack of faith in the possibilities of mutuality and learning in politics so treasured by anarchists and democrats alike.

The great flaw of all these administrative techniques is that, in the name of equality and democracy, they function as a vast “antipolitics machine,” sweeping vast realms of legitimate public debate out of the public sphere and into the arms of technical, administrative committees. They stand in the way of potentially bracing and instructive debates about social policy, the meaning of intelligence, the selection of elites, the value of equity and diversity, and the purpose of economic growth and development. They are, in short, the means by which technical and administrative elites attempt to convince a skeptical public—while excluding that public from the debate—that they play no favorites, take no obscure discretionary action, and have no biases but are merely making transparent technical calculations. They are, today, the hallmark of a neoliberal political order in which the techniques of neoclassical economics have, in the name of scientific calculation and objectivity, come to replace other forms of reasoning.7 Whenever you hear someone say “I’m deeply invested in him/her” or refer to social or human “capital” or, so help me, refer to the “opportunity cost” of a human relationship, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

This principle was powerfully at work in the most moving memorial for Holocaust victims I have ever seen, an exhibition in the great town hall of Münster, where the Treaty of Westphalia was signed in 1648, ending the Thirty Years’ War. Street by street, address by address, name by name, the fate of each and every Jewish family (some six thousand of them) was depicted. There was usually a photograph of the house in which the family lived (most still standing, as Münster was largely spared Allied bombing), the street address, sometimes an identity card or a carte de visite, photographs of the family individually and together (at a picnic, a birthday party, a family photo-portrait), and a note as to their fate: “murdered at Bergen-Belsen,” “fled to France and then Cuba,” “migrated to Israel from Morocco,” “fled to Lodz, Poland, fate unknown.” In quite a few cases there were no photographs, just a dotted rectangle indicating where a photograph would go. It was, above all, a municipal exhibition for the citizenry of Münster. They could stroll from street to street, as it were, and see the Jews who had been their neighbors or those of their parents and grandparents, their houses, their faces—often reflecting happier moments—beaming out at them. It was the powerful particularity, the individuality, and its massive repetition that made it so memorable in the literal sense of the word.2 How much more moving it was than many of the other ubiquitous collective memorials to Jews, homosexuals (“On this street corner, homosexuals were assembled for transport to the concentration camps”), handicapped, and Gypsies (Roma and Sinti)!3 Perhaps the most stunning thing about this exhibition, however, was the very process by which it was created. Hundreds of Münster citizens had worked for more than a decade, combing records, authenticating deaths, tracing survivors, and writing personal letters to the thousands they could track, explaining the exhibition they were preparing and asking if the respondents would be willing to complete the record and to contribute a photograph or a note. Many, understandably, refused; many others sent something, and a good many came to Münster to see for themselves. The result spoke for itself, but the process of tracing family histories, locating survivors and their children, and writing them personal letters as star-crossed neighbors across the void of history and death itself was a cathartic, if not cleansing, recognition of a shared and tragic history. Most of those preparing the exhibition were not even born when the Jews were scourged, and one imagines the thousands of painful conversations and recollections the process touched off among the generations in Münster.

The natural impulse to create a coherent narrative to account for our own actions and lives, even when those lives and actions defy any coherent account, casts a retrospective order on acts that may have been radically contingent. Jean-Paul Sartre gives the hypothetical example of a man torn between the obligation of staying and caring for his ill mother or leaving for the front to defend his country. One could substitute the decision to go on strike or stay in the factory, the decision to join a demonstration, etc.) He can’t make up his mind, but the day, like an on-rushing train, arrives, and he must do one thing or the other, though he still hasn’t decided. Let’s say he stays with his sick mother. The next day, Sartre writes, he will be able to tell himself and others why he is the kind of man who would chose to stay with his sick mother. He must, having acted, find a narrative that accounts for what he did. This does not, however, explain why he did what he did; rather, it retrospectively makes sense of—creates a satisfying narrative for—an act that cannot be explained in any other way.

Charting the Journey was published by Sheba Feminist Press, an independent collective founded by six women in London in 1980. They described their mission as giving “priority to the work of women writers who continue to be marginalized. That means more than simply being ready to publish writing by women of colour, or lesbians, or working-class women; it means recognising the multiplicity of voices within these communities—a multiplicity which is frequently overlooked by a world quick to categorize and dismiss. Sheba has built its reputation around its commitment to diversity, to difference, and to open and critical debate.” In addition to classics such as Charting the Journey, so important to the emergence of a collective we called Black British feminism, Sheba published works by Audre Lorde, bringing her writing to the sweaty hands of feminist readers in the UK for the first time. Another publication from Sheba was titled Turning the Tables: Recipes and Reflections from Women, which contained recipes from feminist writers such as novelist Angela Carter and filmmaker Pratibha Parmar as well as reflections on the politics of domestic labor, including cooking. The editor of that volume, Sue O’Sullivan, describes how the idea for the book “came out of some wonderful, exhausted, tipsy talks that three of us from Sheba had while unwinding after hot, hard, work at the second International Feminist Book Fair.”12 Besides being a collection of recipes, the book also gives space to contributors “to contextualise their recipes in daily life.” The expression “turn the table” can mean to change a situation, often by reversing a power dynamic. They turn the table by turning to the table, so that cooking becomes not about the happiness duty or unpaid labor, but something we claim back for ourselves.

Dominant systems make so much and so many impossible. We have to fight for possibility. We have to fight for some of us to be possible. So much that has come to be is wrapped up by fatalism—gender fatalism, institutional fatalism: girls will be girls, boys, boys, institutions, institutions. Judith Butler suggests that “for those who are still looking to become possible, possibility is necessity.” Possibility is built out of a system.

Common sense, on the contrary, would suggest that the burden of proof should lie on the man who wants to introduce a change; he has to demonstrate that there cannot be any damaging consequences. But this would take too much time, and would therefore be uneconomic. Ecology, indeed, ought to be a compulsory subject for all economists, whether professionals or laymen, as this might serve to restore at least a modicum of balance. For ecology holds "that an environmental setting developed over millions of years must be considered to have some merit. Anything so complicated as a planet, inhabited by more than a million and a half species of plants and animals, all of them living together in a more or less balanced equilibrium in which they continuously use and re-use the same molecules of the soil and air, cannot be improved by aimless and uninformed tinkering.

The following statement was made six years ago. At the time, it seemed highly unorthodox, ' The religion of economics promotes an idolatry of rapid change, unaffected by the elementary truism that a change which is not an unquestionable improvement is a doubtful blessing. The burden of proof is placed on those who take the "ecological viewpoint": unless they can produce evidence of marked injury to man, the change will proceed. Common sense, on the contrary, would suggest that the burden of proof should lie on the man who wants to introduce a change; he has to demonstrate that there cannot be any damaging consequences.

The question of what technology actually does for us is therefore worthy of investigation. It obviously greatly reduces some kinds of work while it increases other kinds. The type of work which modern technology is most successful in reducing or even eliminating is skilful, productive work of human hands. in touch with real materials of one kind or another. In an advanced industrial society, such work has become exceedingly rare, and to make a decent living by doing such work has become virtually impossible. A great part of the modern neurosis may be due to this very fact; for the human being, defined by Thomas Aquinas as a being with brains and hands, enjoys nothing more than to be creatively, usefully, productively engaged with both his hands and his brains. Today, a person has to be wealthy to be able to enjoy this simple thing, this very great luxury: he has to be able to afford space and good tools; he has to be-lucky enough to find a good teacher and plenty of free time to learn and practise. He really has to be rich enough not to need a job: for the number of jobs that would be satisfactory in these respects is very small indeed.

Could it be that the relative failure of aid, or at least our disappointment with the effectiveness of aid, has something to do with our materialist philosophy which makes us liable to overlook the most important preconditions of success, which are generally in- visible? Or if we do not entirely overlook them, we tend to treat them just as we treat material things - things that can be planned and scheduled and purchased with money according to some all- comprehensive development plan. In other words, we tend to think of development, not in terms of evolution, but in terms of creation.

But the financial crisis ushered in a radically different macroeconomic era. Western central banks drove down interest rates to close to zero, or even below; and that is where rates remained, by and large, until as recently as 2022. The effect was a dramatic reduction in yields not only on government but also corporate debt. Thus, having come to rely primarily on bonds to earn investment income in the face of the long-term fall in dividend yields, institutional investors were now faced with the novel scenario of not being able to rely on any mainstream financial assets for the generation of recurring annual income at healthy rates of return; US public pension schemes, for example, cut their portfolio allocation to debt securities from around 30 to around 20 per cent between 2009 and 2021.

In 2017, for instance, Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, urged the US administration of Donald Trump to ensure that publicly commissioned infrastructure projects were brought to market ‘in a format appropriate for institutional investment’. What did he mean by ‘appropriate’? ‘These projects must deliver competitive returns’, Fink clarified.62 Similar arguments have repeatedly been made by trade bodies such as the Global Infrastructure Investor Association, which, representing the interests of institutional investors, assiduously stresses the alleged benefits of using private finance to deliver infrastructure, and ‘work[s] with governments and public bodies to create the right environment to unlock more private capital and increase infrastructure investment’.63 To an increasing extent, what Western governments have essentially done since the financial crisis is de-risk private-sector infrastructure investment, in just the manner called for by the likes of Fink. The UK’s first National Infrastructure Plan, in 2010, set the tone, the language already being that of ‘creating the optimum environment for investment’, of ‘reducing the level of risk transfer to the private sector’, and thus of offering ‘relatively certain economic returns’. The immediate objective could not have been more transparent: to make UK infrastructure ‘an attractive asset class’.64 Nothing has changed in the past decade or so. In 2014, the Treasury freely admitted that the UK government paid ‘particular regard to the effect on investor confidence’ when amending infrastructure-related regulation. So concerned has the government been not to scare investors away through heavy-handed regulation that it provides guarantees – a total figure of £40 billion was cited in 2014 – if it fears that ‘major infrastructure projects may struggle to access private finance’.65 Furthermore, when, towards the end of the decade, the National Infrastructure Commission (a sister agency to the Infrastructure and Projects Authority) addressed the matter of a widely reported decline in confidence in the UK’s system of infrastructure regulation among the public due to rising costs and poor-quality services, its insistence that public confidence in the system ‘must be improved’ was justified not for the sake of the public, but rather ‘to enable long-term certainty for investors’.66

But the financial crisis changed the calculus.71 Not only was US single-family housing suddenly cheap, prices having fallen by 50 per cent or more in areas most affected by the subprime debacle and the ensuing surge in foreclosures. Equally importantly, large, cash-rich buyers now had the opportunity both to buy large numbers of dwellings and then to operate them as rental units, with unprecedented levels of efficiency. The fact that the crisis was geographically concentrated in foreclosure hotspots was critical. Buyers could pick up hundreds of properties in one swoop at weekly or monthly foreclosure auctions, and the clustering of those dwellings in particular neighbourhoods made letting them much less of a logistical challenge than it might otherwise have been.

The financial crisis saw the aggregation of large numbers of distressed residential mortgages within several different federal-government domains, in particular the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the effectively nationalised government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After the crisis, both HUD and the GSEs sold off large numbers of these loans (more than 100,000 in each case) at fire-sale prices, in batches of a scale that only investors such as large asset managers were in a position to acquire. The loans sold by HUD, for instance, were typically priced at discounts of 20–30 per cent on the market value of the underlying property, and 30–50 per cent against the unpaid principal balance.72 Thus, investors were able to acquire houses by buying these discounted loans, and then foreclosing on the mortgage holder – an opportunity they took up on a large scale.

Given the limited fiscal capacity of many governments in the Global South, private-sector investment is widely seen as being even more essential to plugging infrastructure gaps there than it is in the Global North. Calls for private finance capital to respond to this need for investment have escalated markedly in recent times. Much of the solicitation has come from development-oriented organisations such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, both of which have been publicly making such calls for more than a decade. A key moment came with 2015’s Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The third of three UN-hosted international conferences on Financing for Development, the first of which was held in 2002, the Addis Ababa conference and resulting Agenda signalled a decisive shift in development policy towards catalysing specifically private financial investment, and it triggered other influential initiatives such as the World Bank’s own Maximizing Finance for Development. So central have development institutions been to the shift in emphasis towards private finance that many see this shift as evidence of nothing less than a new development paradigm, wherein traditional foreign aid comes to be valued less for its own sake than as a mechanism for crowding-in profit-seeking private capital.

Finally, in recent years asset managers have also begun to invest in manufactured-housing communities, especially in the United States. Typically, mobile homes themselves are owned by their occupants – but they do not own the land on which their homes are located. They rent their sites from the community owner, to whom they also pay fees for shared amenities, services and utilities. The ownership and operation of such manufactured-housing communities is a business that asset managers have widely entered. Apollo Global Management, Blackstone and the Carlyle Group are all significant investors in this space. By 2020, for example, Blackstone’s portfolio of US manufactured-housing assets – held through the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) – had grown to over 7,000 sites, spread across more than forty communities.9

This reflects that the region has greater demand for new infrastructure capabilities than its more developed counterparts, like Europe, where three-quarters of deals are for existing revenue-producing assets.’46 In other words, the money that asset managers put into infrastructure deals in Asia frequently goes to building new assets, while in Europe most deals finance asset retrofitting or even simple title transfer. This indicates a very different investment economy. Asset managers and their institutional investors frequently wax lyrical about their role in helping build the world’s crucial infrastructures – ‘providing infrastructure that improves national, regional and local economies’, in the words of the Global Infrastructure Investor Association.47 While this has never been what they principally do, in Asia, at least, the reality does appear to bear a somewhat greater resemblance to the rhetoric.

Where multi-family housing, the biggest investment sub-class, is concerned, perhaps the most noteworthy European territory in terms of developments of the past decade is Spain. As in the United States, homeowners in Spain came under intense pressure as a result of the global financial crisis, as housing market values slumped and unemployment soared. Many lost their homes to foreclosure, and Spain’s lenders – themselves battling to remain solvent – sold large numbers of these foreclosed homes to US-based asset managers. Moreover, again repeating the US pattern, those managers also acquired large numbers of homes by purchasing portfolios of delinquent mortgages and carrying out selective foreclosures themselves. One of the biggest investors in Spanish housing among US asset managers has been Blackstone.56

Before moving on to a selection of the key actors in asset-manager society, one final observation concerning that society’s geographical configuration is important. The fact that asset managers themselves may be based in, say, New York, London or Paris, does not mean that the all-important funds that they use to pool together limited-partner capital and make portfolio investments occupy the same location. Over the years, significant competition has arisen between national and subnational territorial jurisdictions as to which can offer asset managers the most beneficial – in other words, feeble – combination of tax and regulation for the legal domicile of their funds. Where exactly managers choose to establish investment funds ultimately depends on many factors, including the range of jurisdictions from which the limited partners in those funds originate. The upshot of this is that the past few decades have seen the emergence of a far-flung network of key domiciliary nodes where much of the back-office administration of managers’ myriad funds occurs; this network is now a crucial part of the institutional plumbing of asset-manager society. The likes of Bermuda and the Channel Islands are part of it, but the bulk of funds established by North American and European asset managers to invest in infrastructure or housing tend today to be domiciled in either the US state of Delaware, the Cayman Islands or Luxembourg – or in some combination of these. Asset-manager society is thus deeply embedded – financially and legally, if not physically – in the shadowy spatial world of tax havens and ‘offshore’.

Bayonne, I will argue, is the norm. The costs incurred by residents and by the state in Bayonne and Missoula because of their water-supply systems coming under the control of asset managers – costs ranging from ‘skimped’ investment to increased user rates and heightened risk – are the costs associated with asset-manager society more generally. And, crucially, such costs are not accidental. Rather, they are the more or less inevitable upshot of core features of the model by which asset-manager society operates. They are, in short, a feature, not a bug.

Asset-manager ownership of infrastructure and housing, we shall see, does not in fact reduce risks to governments and taxpayers; it exacerbates them. It does not relieve and liberate governments, giving them freedom of action; it tends instead to constrain them and the futures that they endeavour to fashion. And asset-manager society definitely does not maximise investment and service quality over the long term; for a variety of reasons, but especially due to an impetus to rapid turnover of assets – with waterworks passing from KKR to Argo, and housing from Fifteen Group to Kennedy Wilson to Blackstone – it is in fact a locus precisely of short-termism, with all the implications for asset custodianship that such an ethos implies.

Promoted as a means of expanding geographies of infrastructural provision to underserviced locations against a background of historically uneven patterns of state-financed infrastructure investment, PPPs, at least in the transportation sector, have in fact done nothing of the sort, tending instead to reinforce or even exacerbate existing spatial inequalities of provision. Urban transportation PPPs came to be ‘concentrated in the largest and wealthiest cities in a small number of countries’. Siemiatcki found this outcome easy to explain: different projects proposed by governments had widely varying levels of attractiveness to private investors, and investors had, ‘unsurprisingly, selected the most profitable projects with the lowest risks’.14

Michael Pryke and John Allen have examined a notable and instructive example of real assets that might otherwise have been considered too risky, being structured specifically with a view to rendering them investible by finance capital. It is an example we encountered already: the Carlsbad desalination plant in Southern California (see Chapter 1). The original owner of the plant, before it was sold to Aberdeen Standard Investments in 2019, was a joint-venture vehicle established by two of the world’s leading infrastructure asset managers, Brookfield Asset Management and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, which financed the investment with a combination of equity raised principally from limited partners, and securitised debt. A Water Purchase Agreement was signed with the San Diego County Water Authority in 2012, under which the authority agreed to purchase a stated volume of water at a set unit price over a thirty-year period, ‘regardless of whether the water [was] needed or not by the residents of San Diego’.17 What particularly intrigued Pryke and Allen was how that unit price of water was set. It turned out that it was based not on the market for water so much as on the market for money, being ‘structured financially by Stonepeak to meet the projected equity return and bond interest rates over the lifetime of the project’. In other words, Carlsbad ‘was “engineered” to meet the future financial yields of equity and bond investors across the globe’: over half the contracted household water price represented investors’ capital costs.18

The UK’s Private Finance Initiative (PFI), for example, has become notorious for the cast-iron revenue guarantees that it grants to asset managers, thus mitigating all demand risk. As we saw in Chapter 1, PFI projects are structured in such a way as to trigger guaranteed annual ‘unitary payments’ to the private owner of the PFI contract over the course of the contract life. These payments are made irrespective of the level and nature of actual usage of whatever the physical asset is that the government has procured through the contract – for instance a school, a road or a hospital.

A more widely reported example is that of the long-term parking concessions granted by the City of Chicago in the 2000s. In 2006, the asset manager Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners (MSIP) paid $563 million for a ninety-nine-year concession to run the city’s underground parking garages. Two years later, the city signed a seventy-five-year concession to its 36,000-strong street-parking meter system, for which an investor consortium led by MSIP (with a 50.01 per cent stake) paid $1.15 billion. Under both deals, the bulk of the risk was absorbed by the city, with all manner of clauses inserted in the concession contracts to protect the ‘interests’ of the investors. Among the most significant were ‘adverse action’ and non-compete clauses. I will consider the former as they applied to the parking-meter concession and the latter in relation to the garages concession, although in reality both types of clauses were included in both agreements. Under the parking-meter deal, the city would be liable to pay so-called true-up penalties to MSIP and its partners in the event of ‘adverse actions’ such as the temporary removal of any parking meters from service – due to street closures, for example. It turned out that adverse actions – as defined by the contract – were commonplace. In 2012 alone, Stephanie Farmer has reported, the investor consortium charged the city $61 million in true-up revenue for the use of parking spots by non-paying (for example, disabled) motorists, and for street closures due to construction works, festivals and other events. This total penalty, remarkably, was nearly three times the annual sum ($22 million) that the city had earned from the meter system just six years earlier – when it was still in public ownership. In other words, from the city’s perspective, the concession deal had in one fell swoop transformed the meter system from ‘a revenue-generating source … into an annual budgetary expenditure’.28 Meanwhile, under the garages deal, a non-compete clause obliged the city to protect the monopoly rights and market share of MSIP by not permitting the opening of new parking facilities within wide areas around the garages covered by the concession; the clause allowed MSIP to extract compensation from the city if it did grant such permission. Just three years after the award of the concession, in 2009, the city council approved a parking garage just one block from one of the concessioned lots. Unsurprisingly, MSIP sued. The case went to an independent arbitrator, who in 2013 ruled that the city had breached the contract and would have to pay up. The city’s lawyers tried to fight the decision – suing in county then state court to overturn the arbitrator’s ruling – but failed. In 2015, by which time Morgan Stanley had sold the concession to a consortium of new financial investors, the city settled, at a cost of more than $62 million. The words of Justice James R. Epstein of the Illinois Appellate Court are worth noting. The court could not side with the city, he ruled, ‘irrespective of the unfortunate impact upon taxpayers’.29

What do August and others mean when they say that asset managers and other financial institutions that invest in real assets are financialised actors? The literature contains both relatively loose and more conceptually precise definitions. In attacking financialised landlords for running their businesses on the basis of ‘financial logics, metrics, and priorities’, August’s own critique is an example of the former.44 ‘Financialized landlords’, she says, ‘extract needlessly high rents, systematically transferring income from working people to wealthy fund managers and investors.’45 The more precise definition is that a financialised owner-operator treats housing or infrastructure like a financial asset, thus ‘financialising’ it, too. But what exactly does treating a house or item of infrastructure ‘like’ a financial asset entail? Here, the venerable political-economic categories of exchange value and use value come into play. The uniqueness of financial assets as such is that they have only exchange value, and no use value. Hence, to financialise (or treat as financial) a non-financial asset is to deny or disregard its use value – a house’s value as shelter, for instance – by wholly subordinating such value to the asset’s value-in-exchange. In practice, critics argue, this means that asset managers and other ‘financialised’ owner-operators come to treat housing and infrastructure as ‘just another asset class’ – which is to say, precisely akin to actual financial assets such as stocks or bonds. This claim has been explicitly made for both built real-estate and farmland, for example.46

The imperative to cut operating costs typically impinges on two main stakeholder constituencies. The first is an asset’s users. If the apartment you live in, the land you farm, the water main supplying your home or the hospital you are taken to for surgery is acquired by an asset manager, and if that manager then seeks to cut the cost of maintaining its new asset, you will more likely than not suffer accordingly. The second constituency is the workers employed to carry out this asset maintenance. As we saw in Chapter 1, it is not Blackstone or Brookfield or Macquarie’s own investment professionals who clean hospital floors, man toll-road booths and respond to residential-tenant complaints about leaking taps. All those tasks are outsourced under service contracts. Workers’ wage-cheques suffer to the degree that the asset manager is successful in squeezing labour costs.

In the case of Invitation Homes during its existence as a Blackstone-controlled entity, tensions ran especially high in California, the company’s second most important regional market after Florida. There, Invitation Homes tenants stormed Blackstone offices on three separate occasions in protest at rent hikes and alleged property neglect. In October 2017, ‘more than three dozen renters of homes across Los Angeles burst through the front door of Blackstone’s headquarters in Santa Monica, shaking noisemakers, honking sirens and chanting through megaphones: “Hey, Blackstone, shame on you,” “Slumlord,” and, “You are being evicted, Blackstone!” Blackstone executives rushed out of the building through the emergency exits and the back door.’73 The corporate response to this seeming indignity? When, the following year, Californians voted state-wide on a proposal to enhance the ability of Californian municipalities to control rents (specifically by revoking 1995’s Costa–Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which substantially constrains that ability), Blackstone–Invitation Homes donated a reported $6.8 million to the ultimately successful campaign against the proposal.74 Blackstone’s eyes remained firmly set on the prize of further profitable disposals of Invitation Homes stock, an end to which rent maximisation continued to be indispensable. In 2019, with just two years remaining until termination of BREP VII, Blackstone sold its last shares in Invitation Homes. Its funds had made an estimated $3.5 billion in total profit from the seven-year investment.75

incentivised to squeeze operating expenditures associated with real-asset investments, they have an even greater incentive to avoid capital expenditures – that is, expenditures that are expected to provide utility beyond the very near term. After all, if the overriding objective is to exit within, say, three to five years of investment, there will in general be no reason to spend money whose returns would be realised wholly or primarily beyond that limited time horizon. It would be economically irrational to do so; and the closer to exit the asset manager edges, needless to say, the smaller the incentive becomes to invest for the long term.

Blackstone wagered that it could – and it was right. In 2018, for example, it spent 903 million Swedish kronor (SEK) renovating 1,626 apartments. It succeeded in immediately increasing the average annualised rent on these apartments by 491 SEK/m2 (from 1,021 to 1,512).82 If we assume that the average size of the renovated apartments matched the average size of all Hembla apartments at that time (79m2), this represented a cumulative annualised rent increase of 63 million kronor. And there was seemingly negligible impact on occupancy: vacancy rates across the whole Hembla portfolio rose only marginally in 2018, from 1.3 to 1.5 per cent.83 And the market did indeed valorise Blackstone’s investment. In September 2019, less than three years after it had taken control, Blackstone offloaded its majority stake in Hembla to Germany’s Vonovia for 12.2 billion SEK (around €1.1 billion), the exit realising a reported profit of approximately 6 billion SEK.84 Meanwhile, large numbers of Hembla tenants were themselves also ‘exiting’ – although in their case generally not voluntarily. Unable to bear the average rent spikes of some 50 per cent, many tenants of renovated apartments moved out not because they wanted to, but because they had to. Hembla is one of the landlords that has been at the centre of a growing political storm in Sweden around practices of so-called ‘renoviction’ – that is, eviction of tenants from their homes resulting from renovations, whether the ‘eviction’ is initiated by the landlord or by the embattled tenant herself. There are circumstances, then, in which closed-end funds undertake significant capital spending on real assets in their portfolios. But this is generally only when they are compelled, or when what might appear to be investment for the long term can be monetised in the short term. Otherwise the incentive for such expenditure is intrinsically absent. The implication of this should be self-evident: housing and infrastructure assets under this type of ownership do not ordinarily receive the capital investment they need, and so they physically deteriorate.

The first thing to observe about this second hypothetical scenario is that such disasters do happen. For all the de-risking frequently extended to real-asset asset managers (see Chapter 4), some funds are failures, which has highly damaging consequences – not least for invested pension schemes. Consider the experiences of the aforementioned Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS). In the early to mid 2000s, PSERS began aggressively to increase allocations to alternative asset classes, including real assets. Because the fees charged on real-asset funds are much higher than on traditional bond or public-equity funds, the payments that PSERS made to asset managers ballooned: by 2019, such payments had grown to more than $700 million each year. Only two of the approximately seventy-five other US public pension schemes tracked by Pew Charitable Trusts were paying higher fees relative to assets under management.13 PSERS ended up losing large amounts of the money it committed to real-asset funds. This was vividly the case for several real-estate funds launched in 2006 and 2007, shortly before the global financial crisis struck and led to a widespread collapse in property values, to which PSERS had committed significant sums. To take four prime examples, it lost $65 million of the $180 million it had invested in the real-estate asset manager Beacon Capital’s Strategic Partners V fund (launched in 2007); $223 million of the $291 million it had invested in two real-estate funds launched by Broadway Partners (2006 and 2007); $67 million of the $281 million it had put into Carlyle’s Europe Real Estate Partners III fund (2007); and fully $446 million of the $654 million it had sunk into two Morgan Stanley real-estate funds (both 2006).14 These were nothing less than catastrophic losses.

Given what we now know about the position of structural privilege enjoyed by asset managers and pension-scheme managers in being able to avoid any losses sustained by investment funds, it is interesting to note who exactly was being sued in the PSERS case. It was not the actual asset managers that PSERS had used. It was not even PSERS itself: as an arm of state government, it is generally protected from liability under the state’s Sovereign Immunity Act. Instead, lawyers had to satisfy themselves with suing two consultants to PSERS, alleging that they had been ‘grossly negligent’ in their dealings with the scheme and that their advice had led to ‘significant and traceable losses’ from the alternative investment vehicles to which PSERS had committed so much capital.

The OECD has estimated that, of $56 trillion of global retirement savings in 2020, some $54 trillion was held in OECD countries, and that North America and the UK alone accounted for nearly 80 per cent of the OECD total.

All of which is to say that the generic ‘citizen’ that the GIIA and other champions of Western asset management identify as being the pre-eminent beneficiary of the sector’s operations in fact has a predominant social location as well as a predominant geographical one. Saving for retirement, he or she is almost always based in North America or Europe, and is generally a high earner. Certainly, the likes of Blackstone do invest the retirement savings of some teachers, nurses and firefighters – the outsized allocations to real-asset funds by the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System, for example, have shown us as much. But, compared to the universe of workers more widely, such workers do not have significant retirement savings. As and where asset managers generate capital gains for pension-scheme members, those gains are in reality captured disproportionately not by teachers, nurses and firefighters, but by bankers, lawyers and consultants.

In the illustrative scenarios explored in the previous section of this chapter, we assumed that all external investors in our hypothetical real-asset fund were pension schemes. Clearly, however, that was not a realistic assumption. If 62 per cent of the approximately 5,000 separate institutional-investor commitments globally to closed-end infrastructure funds between 1990 and 2020 were pension-fund commitments, then it follows that nearly 40 per cent of investments were not made by pension schemes.

Meanwhile, alongside high-net-worth individuals, the three other most important categories of investor in real-asset funds (aside from pension schemes) are all institutional actors. Insurance companies are one; banks are another – and indeed, these two types of investor, both of which invest via asset managers principally to boost profits and shareholder returns, accounted between them for nearly 20 per cent of the roughly 5,000 historic commitments to closed-end infrastructure funds mentioned above.22 The third category – returning us to the example of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners – is sovereign-wealth funds (SWFs).

Consider Saudi Arabia’s PIF itself. Does Blackstone perform a socially beneficial role by investing on behalf of this entity? Hardly. It would be spurious to suggest that PIF, one of the world’s largest SWFs, exists to benefit ordinary Saudi citizens. As the country was enduring one of its worst economic crises in decades in early 2020, for instance, and the government was trebling value-added tax while slashing domestic spending, PIF was busy buying stakes in international companies ranging from Boeing to Facebook. Its overseas spending spree, observed Anuj Chopra, belied ‘deep and unpopular austerity measures’ at home. One observer wondered aloud ‘how Saudi citizens view their savings and collective national nest egg being spent on international equity markets at a time of a national economic crisis’. Why indeed, asked Chopra, were PIF’s vast resources – its assets were valued at around $500 billion in 2021 – ‘not instead used to prop up struggling small and medium enterprises choked by the pandemic?’23

In particular, consider again the example of SWFs. In 2018, private-equity funds globally managed $2.97 trillion of investor capital. More than half of this – some $1.54 trillion – was from just 359 investors, referred to by Preqin as the ‘Billion Dollar Club’ – meaning that each such investor had at least $1 billion invested in private equity. Of the total population of institutional investors of all sizes globally with investments in private equity, only 1 per cent happened to be SWFs. But when it focused on its more exclusive subset of larger ‘Billion Dollar’ private-equity investor, Preqin found the SWF share to be higher: 4 per cent of Club members were SWFs. And the SWF share of invested capital – the measure that really matters – was much higher still. No less than 14 per cent – $215 billion – of the $1.5 trillion collectively held in private equity by the Club was capital from just fourteen SWFs.27 In other words, one really should not read too much into alternative asset managers’ pronouncements that pension schemes – and, in particular, teachers, nurses and firefighters saving for retirement – are the third-party constituency they represent. It is certainly true that pension schemes are important real-asset (and private-equity) clients. But so, too, are banks, insurance companies and SWFs – much more important than either asset managers’ own proclamations, or indeed much of the existing independent analysis of the alternative asset-management sector, would lead one to believe. Only about one in fifty of historic commitments to closed-end infrastructure funds globally have been made by SWFs like Saudi Arabia’s PIF.28 But we can be sure that the SWF share of the capital committed to and invested by those infrastructure funds, and thus of the returns that such funds have generated, has been far higher than that.

Asset-manager society is nothing if not a creature of the modern world – a world riven by inequalities of wealth and power. Asset managers take those inequalities as they are – inequalities embodied in the very capital committed to their investment funds – and actively reproduce them. The very last thing they do is challenge or alleviate such inequalities. Indeed, arguably the signal lesson of Blackstone’s 2017 deal with PIF is that, if asset managers like Blackstone really do have a prototypical investor whose interests they faithfully serve, it is not a humble Pennsylvanian schoolteacher or Californian firefighter, but rather the likes of Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the chairman at one of the world’s most profitable companies, the oil giant Saudi Aramco; of north-east England’s most popular football club, Newcastle United; and of the world’s most notorious sovereign wealth fund – which is, of course, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.

In strictly financial terms, the commitment to Blackstone’s new infrastructure fund that Saudi Arabia’s PIF made in 2017 was notable not only for its size but also for the preferential terms that PIF secured. Throughout this book, including in my examination of a hypothetical fund earlier in this chapter, I have assumed both relatively standard fee terms – the ‘two and twenty’ model, at least for closed-end funds – and that all investors in the same fund pay the same fees. In reality, however, investors do not always pay the same fees. Terms vary both between and within funds: they are negotiable.

In the boosterist discourse surrounding and buttressing asset-manager society, public-sector employees, as we have seen, invariably enjoy pride of place. It is for them, it is said, that asset managers make money. But, in reality, such employees – the firefighter, the nurse, the teacher – are utterly peripheral to the rewards ledger. Not only do they hold only a very limited proportion of the vast retirement-savings capital that asset managers invest – and, of course, an even smaller share of total invested capital from all institutional sources. They also suffer the indignity of realising subpar rates of return from the managed investment of those meagre resources.

This was very much a common way of things, for example, in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century. Local governments raised money for building infrastructure such as roads, sewers and schools principally by issuing bonds, and among the main buyers of those bonds were public pension schemes, which in that era were restricted in most states to investing in debt raised by public bodies. As late as 1942, municipal bonds accounted for approximately 70 per cent of all US public-pension investment holdings.36 Insofar as the yields on such bonds were lower than yields on financial assets with equivalent risk profiles, public retirement savings indirectly subsidised the construction of public-use infrastructure. Only after World War II, when rules on investment by public-pension schemes were progressively relaxed and scheme administrators went in search of higher returns in corporate bonds and stocks, did the share of municipal bonds in US public-pension investment portfolios start to fall, dropping to below 20 per cent by 1957, and to below 1 per cent by 1972 – which was effectively the point at which we picked up the story in Chapter 2. The point of rehearsing this history here is that it accentuates by way of contrast a key, historically specific characteristic of the contemporary scheme of things. Today, in buying into infrastructure funds, public pension schemes, among others, once again often find themselves in the position of explicitly supporting the construction of public-use infrastructures: witness AP3 and the North Lanarkshire school system. But the intermediary who controls, channels and profits from such support is now of a radically different nature.

The second key feature of the case of SHP and the Solna hospital was, of course, the specific identity of the recipient of these tax-suppressing interest payments – namely, Innisfree itself. Essentially, the reason that the state would not make gains (in the form of tax receipts) in this case was that the asset manager would do so: such is the crux of fiscal extractivism. During the course of the relatively brief history of asset-manager society, the particular type of loan advanced by Innisfree to SHP has indeed represented a common vehicle of said extractivism. A so-called shareholder loan, it involves one or more shareholders lending money to the company in which equity is held (see Chapter 1). The higher the interest rate, the higher the interest payment to the shareholder, and hence the lower the tax payment to the government.

Meanwhile, Jason Ward has recounted an instructive Australian example. Upon buying the care-home chain Allity from Lend Lease Group in 2013, using its fifth buyout fund, the asset manager Archer Capital provided Allity with a loan paying it (Archer) interest of 15 per cent. Despite subsequently recording profits before interest of around A$300 million in both 2014–15 and 2015–16, Allity reported zero taxable income in either year. Ward concluded that there was ‘little doubt that the sole purpose of this shareholder loan at a 15% interest was to reduce taxable income on profits’.

SHP–Innisfree, it is important to note that shareholder loans are not the only mechanism that asset-management firms active in the real-assets space use to extract at source income that one ordinarily would have expected to flow to the state as tax revenues. Perversely, some alternative such mechanisms include ones designed and proffered by the state itself. Many Western governments, for example, allow companies that generate the bulk of their revenue from the letting of real estate to incorporate themselves as real-estate investment trusts (REITs). In doing so, such companies are able to shield most of their profits from income taxes, and to distribute such profits in the form of shareholder dividends. It is no accident that, where national provisions allow, asset managers almost always use REIT structures to hold their real-estate portfolios, including their housing portfolios. In Blackstone’s case, for instance, Invitation Homes – its original US single-family housing rental operation – was, as it remains, a REIT; so too are the various companies through which Black-stone holds most of its Spanish residential-property assets – one of the largest of these being Fidere Patrimonio, which owns thousands of rental units located principally in Madrid, and in which Blackstone funds own around 99 per cent of the shares.

Asset managers’ private debt funds, sometimes also referred to as private credit funds, operate in much the same way as the equity funds with which we are more familiar. They pool money from external investors (their limited partners), and their general partners earn fees by managing and investing that client capital. But instead of using the committed capital to buy shares and take asset ownership and control (the staple operation of asset-manager society), private debt funds invest by making long-term loans, which constitute ‘private’ debt inasmuch as it is not issued or traded in an open market; and such funds generate income in the form of interest payments, as opposed to dividends and capital gains. Although such funds have existed for decades, they have risen to prominence only since the global financial crisis. As banks increasingly withdrew from what they considered to be ‘risky’ lending, asset managers stepped into the breach. The total client capital managed by private debt funds increased from less than $200 billion in 2007 to over $800 billion by 2019.43 A year later, that figure had reached $1 trillion.44

If anybody had been in any doubt about how much this tax treatment mattered to asset managers’ financial bottom line, such doubt was summarily dispelled when, in 2010, President Obama moved to close the carry tax-loophole in the United States. The industry united in indignation. The response specifically of Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman – himself worth $40 billion – was nothing short of jaw-dropping: he compared the threat from Obama to Hitler’s invasion of Poland.48 Obama’s gambit failed, and, both in the United States and farther afield, the carried-interest tax provision survives. Writing in the New York Times in 2017, James Stewart called the US provision ‘a tax loophole for the rich that just won’t die’.49 Like the proverbial cockroach that not even a nuclear explosion can kill off, the most recent demonstration of the loophole’s remarkable obduracy came in 2022. Critics were jubilant when it was reported that ‘closure’ of the loophole would be one of the means of funding the US Inflation Reduction Act (on which, see Chapter 6). But the fine print revealed that the proposal was not in fact to close the loophole, only to modestly circumscribe asset managers’ ability to exploit it. And, in the event, even that weak proposed inhibition proved too much for the country’s political economy to accommodate. Only once the carried-interest proposal was scrapped did the legislation pass.50

The reality is that, across the Global North, governments have for several decades been widely, if unevenly, withdrawing from the ownership and funding of housing and other essential infrastructures, and for all the hoopla about the state suddenly being ‘back’, Covid-19 changed that trajectory not one jot: not in Australia, not in Europe, and certainly not in the United States. US municipalities – the principal owners of US public infrastructure – have increasingly been considering public–private partnerships not necessarily because they want to, but because federal funding has dried up – declining by around 75 per cent in real terms since the late 1970s in the case of water infrastructure, for example.16 In the midst of the pandemic, faced with a ‘dire’ need for capital, municipalities were widely welcoming asset managers’ PPP proposals.17 Biden’s legislation barely scratched the surface of that need for capital (least of all in relation to water supply), which will instead increasingly be met by other capital providers.

Gabor has described this phenomenon of Western governments ‘escorting’ Global North asset managers into de-risked infrastructure assets in the Global South as nothing less than a new development paradigm, dubbed ‘the Wall Street Consensus’. In fact, she suggests that it represents a ‘strategic Western response’ precisely to the BRI.22 The ‘strategic’ part appeared debatable when her article was published in early 2021, inasmuch as, up until then, de-risking had been largely ad hoc rather than coordinated. That June, however, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) economies announced plans for a new partnership, called Build Back Better World. It appeared to be everything Gabor had alluded to: a strategic, coordinated mechanism; oriented to infrastructure investment in poorer countries; professedly an axis of competition with China; and, most crucially of all, to be effectuated by de-risking – specifically using ‘catalytic investments from our respective development finance institutions’ to ‘mobiliz[e] private-sector capital’.23 A year later, in mid 2022, the partnership was formally launched, albeit repackaged and rebranded as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). It aimed to ‘mobilize’ some $600 billion in global infrastructure investment by 2027.24

Investors like Blackstone learned two very important things while buying into housing-market distress in the first half of the 2010s. One was that rental homes, much more than the companies purchased by such investors’ private-equity buyout arms, provided a predictable and reliable source of recurring income, not to mention one that could be very cheaply financed – which was a valuable combination of qualities in the otherwise volatile world of alternative asset management. The second, equally important, concerned the available mechanisms for generating capital gains on housing investments. Here, Blackstone’s own experience with Invitation Homes, the single-family-housing investment vehicle it launched in 2012, proved highly instructive. Buyers of Invitation Homes’ shares at and after the company’s 2017 IPO placed a much higher average value on each of its 50,000-plus rental units than Blackstone had originally paid for those units, both because the housing market had recovered and because each such unit was on average producing increased rental yields (see Chapter 4). The lesson was that, when buying residential property, one did not necessarily need conditions of market distress – and hence the prospect of generalised price inflation – in order to profit when later selling that property. If there was potential to lift rents, one could make capital gains by buying, letting and then selling housing even if the wider market stood still.

For more than a decade now, climate change has been framed by global elites as a quintessential case of ‘market failure’. In this way of thinking, we – society – continue to emit greenhouse gases specifically because the market has failed to recognise the full costs of those emissions. And just as important as the diagnosis is the recommended cure. As thinkers such as Philip Mirowski have repeatedly noted, the neoliberal answer to purported market failures is never to replace markets with other mechanisms of allocation, governance or regulation, but rather always to try to make markets work better. So it has been, and continues to be, with climate.

More than any other representative of the asset-management industry, Fink in recent years has been relentlessly banging the drum of accelerating the climate transition by de-risking private finance. To the degree, therefore, that we are entering an epochal period of investment not just in climate infrastructure, but more particularly in privately held climate infrastructure, what Fink and BlackRock emphatically should not be seen as is merely passive and fortuitously positioned beneficiaries of that development. Rather, if the climate transition does indeed prove to be an ‘historic investment opportunity’ for real-asset asset managers, it is an opportunity that the likes of Fink and Carney will have actively and assiduously helped to create.

With respect to climate issues, BlackRock already had its tentacles firmly wrapped around the EU polity. In April 2020, for example, the European Commission had hired the firm to advise on how best to integrate sustainability considerations into the region’s banking regulation – and this in the face of campaigners’ protests that the firm’s investment holdings in both fossil-fuel companies and European banks raised all manner of conflict-of-interest concerns. BlackRock worked on the study for the next year, delivering its report in May 2021.

Is it really any wonder that the climate infrastructure programme that Biden ended up pursuing in 2021–22 was what Tooze felicitously described as ‘the Green New Deal recast in the image of BlackRock’ – namely a meek, conservative framework designed principally to de-risk private-sector investment, and as such a ‘far cry from the bold vision of the original’?

But after 2009, too, such bold aspirations were unceremoniously snuffed out by the president’s team. In the event, pallid Obama-era housing policy substantially failed distressed homeowners, resulting in the availability of a glut of foreclosed homes to be acquired cheaply by asset managers. The most visible difference from the later case of Biden, BlackRock and climate was simply that a different ‘Black’ was implicated. Whereas Biden would hire from BlackRock, Obama’s housing-finance policy team within the Treasury hired extensively from Blackstone; and Blackstone, as we know, went on to become the biggest institutional buyer of foreclosed single-family homes. If, under Biden, what we are seeing is the Green New Deal recast in the image of BlackRock, then equally, Obama presided over the housing New Deal recast in the image of Blackstone – the ‘Blackstone-ification’ of US housing policy, if you like.

First, and most obviously, we need to consider where in the economy – sectorally, not geographically – prices are rising. Inflation is not a free-floating phenomenon, somehow applying to all commodities equally. It is always a phenomenon of variegated price rises, driven by increases in the prices of some commodities more than others. Today, the bulk of generalised inflation – the headline rates we read about – is in fact inflation in the prices specifically of energy and food. What do these two have in common? They are both commodities increasingly generated within asset-manager society – that is to say, by asset managers with significant holdings of, respectively, energy generation and farmland assets.

Second, and more importantly, investors have long seen real assets as a better hedge against inflation than almost any other significant asset class. As we saw in Chapter 2, one of the main explanations that asset managers and their clients have consistently given for their increasing appetite for infrastructure investment since the mid 1990s has been inflation risk; fees that can be charged to users of regulated infrastructure assets, for example, are often explicitly index-linked. The link is less explicit in the case of housing, but research has widely shown that both house prices and rents typically keep pace with or outstrip the rate of inflation over the medium and long term.

Higher interest rates, he recently noted, ‘will work largely by depressing housing construction, which was already too low’.74 Bad news for renters, certainly – but, by the same token, clearly good news for investor-landlords: enduring and intensifying supply shortages have been the key driver of rising housing rents in the past decade; and asset managers, by their own admission, have invested precisely in those urban housing markets where such shortages of supply – and thus upward pressure on rents – are most pronounced.

It goes without saying that this development has never been about logic. That it is inherently better for infrastructure – or for that matter, housing – to be funded and owned by private-sector investors than by the state is a nonsense economically. This is not just a matter of the Keynesian nostrum, quoted above, that anything that (rich-country) governments can actually do, they can afford. It is also to do with the fact that one reason such governments can afford that which they choose to do is that they can almost always borrow more cheaply than the private sector can. Writing about the US infrastructure investment space in 2017, for instance, Brian Alexander observed that ‘the current average yield on municipal bonds, which is what cities use to build and maintain things like schools, roads, and fire stations, is about 3 per cent’. Meanwhile, private owners backed by asset managers (with their high-leverage model) typically paid ‘much higher interest rates’, which meant that ‘a private owner is more likely down the line to have to, for example, keep the rates high on a toll road’.78

Bruce Flatt, chief executive of Brookfield Asset Management, is more succinct. ‘We’re in a 50-year transformation of the infrastructure world’, Flatt confidently told the Financial Times in 2018. ‘We’re 10 years in; we have 40 left to go. By the end of that 50 years most infrastructure in the world will be transferred to private hands.’77 In terms of numbers, Flatt reckoned that, of a total $100 trillion-worth of infrastructure that would go private, ‘maybe 10 per cent’ had done so thus far. It goes without saying that this development has never been about logic. That it is inherently better for infrastructure – or for that matter, housing – to be funded and owned by private-sector investors than by the state is a nonsense economically.

But, of course, Ford’s explicit injunction to ‘think about it logically’, and the IMF’s implicit injunction to do the same, ultimately miss the point. The growing historic – and, if we have read the runes correctly, likely future – ascendancy of asset managers over society’s vast stock of housing and infrastructure assets has nothing to do with ‘logic’, economic or otherwise. It is, rather, about power. Let us return to Bruce Flatt’s comment regarding the current trajectory of infrastructure ownership. Note that he talked about infrastructure increasingly moving into ‘private hands’. Now, more private ownership of infrastructure does not necessarily mean more asset-manager ownership of infrastructure. But Flatt was nonetheless immensely confident that this would indeed continue to be the case. It more or less went without saying. Why so? The simple answer is that asset managers control the bulk of society’s financial wealth. They, in short, have the money – and, as theorists of money from all manner of conceptual traditions have long maintained, money is nothing if not social power objectified. Without money, you do not get the Blackstone-ification of housing policy and the BlackRock-ification of climate policy.

In the final reckoning, in other words, this book has told a remarkably straightforward story. Housing and infrastructure are widely ending up in asset managers’ hands not because the latter are the most ‘appropriate’ or ‘suitable’ or ‘efficient’ owners of such assets, as if in some gigantic drama of perfectly righteous market clearance. Rather, this is increasingly such assets’ default destination simply because asset managers are cash-and power-rich – arguably more so, in fact, than any other category of economic actor at any time in history.

The Iron Law of Liberalism states that any market reform, any government initiative intended to reduce red tape and promote market forces will have the ultimate effect of increasing the total number of regulations, the total amount of paperwork, and the total number of bureaucrats the government employs. French sociologist Emile Durkheim was already observing this tendency at the turn of the twentieth century,10 and eventually, it became impossible to ignore. By the middle of the century, even right-wing critics like von Mises were willing to admit—at least in their academic writing—that markets don’t really regulate themselves, and that an army of administrators was indeed required to keep any market system going.

The Americans in particular were much more concerned with creating structures of international administration. The very first thing the United States did, on officially taking over the reins from Great Britain after World War II, was to set up the world’s first genuinely planetary bureaucratic institutions in the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions—the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and GATT, later to become the WTO. The British Empire had never attempted anything like this. They either conquered other nations, or traded with them. The Americans attempted to administer everything and everyone.

In the United States, the lines between public and private have long been blurry. The American military, for example, is famous for its revolving door—high-ranking officers involved in procurement regularly end up on the boards of corporations that operate on military contracts. On a broader level, the need to preserve certain domestic industries for military purposes, and to develop others, has allowed the U.S. government to engage in practically Soviet-style industrial planning without ever having to admit it’s doing so. After all, pretty much anything, from maintaining a certain number of steel plants, to doing the initial research to set up the Internet, can be justified on grounds of military preparedness. Yet again, since this kind of planning operates via an alliance between military bureaucrats and corporate bureaucrats, it’s never perceived as something bureaucratic at all.

The representatives of these interests have important agendas and principles that they want to advance, and they are well positioned to shape and constrain media policy. This is normally not accomplished by crude intervention, but by the selection of right-thinking personnel and by the editors’ and working journalists’ internalization of priorities and definitions of newsworthiness that conform to the institution’s policy.

“Genocide” is an invidious word that officials apply readily to cases of victimization in enemy states, but rarely if ever to similar or worse cases of victimization by the United States itself or allied regimes. Thus, with Saddam Hussein and Iraq having been U.S. targets in the 1990s, whereas Turkey has been an ally and client and the United States its major arms supplier as it engaged in its severe ethnic cleansing of Kurds during those years, we find former U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith stating that “while Turkey represses its own Kurds, its cooperation is essential to an American-led mission to protect Iraq’s Kurds from renewed genocide at the hands of Saddam Hussein.”28 Turkey’s treatment of its Kurds was in no way less murderous than Iraq’s treatment of Iraqi Kurds, but for Galbraith, Turkey only “represses,” while Iraq engages in “genocide.”

The victims of Pol Pot, a Communist leader, were worthy, although after he was ousted by the Vietnamese in 1978, Cambodians ceased to be worthy, as U.S. policy shifted toward support of Pol Pot in exile.32 The East Timorese remained unworthy in the 1990s, as the table suggests.

As the leader of the faction insisting on harsh sanctions against Iraq following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the United States itself was responsible for a very large number of Iraqi civilians deaths in the 1990s. John and Karl Mueller assert that these “sanctions of mass destruction” have caused the deaths of “more people in Iraq than have been slain by all socalled weapons of mass destruction [nuclear and chemical] throughout all history.”33 A large fraction of the million or more killed by sanctions were young children; UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy pointed out that “if the substantial reduction in child mortality throughout Iraq during the 1980s had continued through the 1990s, there would have been half a million fewer deaths of children under five in the country as a whole during the eight year period 1991 to 1998.”34 However, as these deaths resulted from U.S. policy, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared on national television that these 500,000 child deaths were “worth it,”35 we would expect the U.S. media to find these victims unworthy, to give them little attention and less indignation, and to find the word “genocide” inapplicable to this case. The table shows that this expectation was realized in media practice.

After the United States terminated the military phase of the war in 1975, it maintained and enforced an eighteen-year boycott of the country that it had virtually destroyed. According to Vietnamese estimates, the war had cost them 3 million killed, 300,000 missing, 4.4 million wounded, and 2 million harmed by toxic chemicals; and its land was left ravaged by bombs and Rome plows as well as chemical weapons. With 58,000 killed, the U.S. death toll from the war was under one-tenth of 1 percent of its population; Vietnam’s death toll was 17 percent of its population, and only Vietnam’s people were attacked by chemical warfare and had their countryside devastated. Nevertheless, U.S. officials and the mainstream media continued to view the U.S. role in the war as creditable, the United States as the victim. President George Bush stated in 1992 that “Hanoi knows today that we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past.”59 That is, the Vietnamese had done things to us that might justify retribution on our part, but we only seek answers regarding our men missing in action.60 New York Times foreign affairs commentator Leslie Gelb justified classifying Vietnam an “outlaw” on the grounds that “they had killed Americans.”61 This reflects the common establishment view, implicit in Bush’s comment, that nobody has a right of self-defense against this country, even if it intervenes across the ocean to impose by force a government that the people of that country reject.

It is also of interest how the media have treated the massive use of chemicals during the Vietnam War and the horrifying aftermath for the victim country. In 1961 and 1962 the Kennedy administration authorized the use of chemicals to destroy rice crops in South Vietnam—in violation of a U.S. tradition as well as international law (Admiral William Leahy, in response to a proposal to destroy Japanese rice crops in 1944, stated that this would “violate every Christian ethic I have ever heard of and all known laws of war”).62 Between 1961 and 1971, however, the U.S. Air Force sprayed 20 million gallons of concentrated arsenic-based and dioxin-laden herbicides (mainly Agent Orange) on 6 million acres of crops and trees, besides using large quantities of the “super tear gas” CS and vast amounts of napalm and phosphorus bombs.63 An estimated 13 percent of South Vietnam’s land was subjected to chemical attacks. This included 30 percent of its rubber plantations and 36 percent of its mangrove forests, along with other large forest areas, destroyed by toxic chemicals in programs that included multiple “large-scale intentional effort[s] combining defoliation with incendiaries to produce a forest fire in South Vietnam.”64 A 1967 study prepared by the head of the Agronomy Section of the Japanese Science Council concluded that U.S. anticrop warfare had already ruined more than 3.8 million acres of arable land in South Vietnam, killing almost 1,000 peasants and over 13,000 livestock.65 This policy of attempting to force enemy capitulation by destroying its food supply was not only contrary to the rules of war,66 it was notable in that it “first and overwhelmingly affected small children.”67

One theme has been that the U.S. intervention was justified by the fact of “communism on the march” (editorial, Washington Post, April 30, 2000). It was argued from the beginning that the Communist advance in Vietnam was part of a global communist conspiracy, a position maintained in the face of the split and hostility between China and the Soviet Union, tension between China and North Vietnam, and the absence of any evidence that North Vietnam was anybody’s tool. In his book In Retrospect,77 former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara admits that he and his colleagues made a serious error on this point. But neither he nor the other establishment figures who have used this argument have ever questioned the U.S. right to intervene by force to stop the “march of communism” in a country where the Communists had led a nationalist revolution, were recognized by all official and nonofficial authorities to command the support of a large majority of the population, and where their defeat would require open aggression, mass killing, and the virtual destruction of a distant society.

Robert McNamara’s widely publicized book, supposedly a mea culpa and moral tract, is notable for the fact that his notion of the war’s “high costs,” and the error and guilt he feels, extend only to U.S. lives and the effects of the war on “the political unity of our society.”81 He offers neither regrets, moral reflections, nor apologies for his country having invaded, mercilessly bombed, ravaged the land, and killed and wounded millions of innocent people in a small distant peasant society in pursuit of its own political ends.

But although there has never been any credible evidence that a single POW was hidden by the North Vietnamese, this claim became an article of faith and cult that dominated U.S. policy toward Vietnam for many years.82 The myth also became the basis of popular culture accounts in movies such as The Deer Hunter, Uncommon Valor, P.O.W.: The Escape, and Missing in Action, in which Rambo-like heroes slaughter evil Vietnamese as they save our betrayed and tormented POWs. These movies turned history on its head. As Vietnam war historian H. Bruce Franklin points out, “America’s vision of the war was being transformed. The actual photographs and TV footage of massacred villagers, napalmed children, Vietnamese prisoners being tortured and murdered, wounded GI’s screaming in agony, and body bags being loaded by the dozen for shipment back home were being replaced by simulated images of American POWs in the savage hands of Asian communists.”83 The powerful cultural myth of abused POWs as the central feature of the Vietnam war not only allowed the war to be extended, it helped justify the U.S. failure to aid its victim in accord with end-of-war promises and it provided the basis for an eighteen-year economic war against the victim country. It also functioned as a potent agent of militarization and force weakening the “Vietnam syndrome.”

Another notable feature of media reporting on both the Seattle and Washington, D.C., protests, and a throwback to their biased treatment of the protests of the Vietnam War era (1965–75),114 was their exaggeration of protester violence, their downplaying of police provocations and violence, and their complaisance at illegal police tactics designed to limit all protestor actions, peaceable or otherwise.115 Although the Seattle police resorted to force and used chemical agents against many nonviolent protesters well before a handful of individuals began breaking windows, both then and later the media reversed this chronology, stating that the police violence was a response to protester violence. In fact, the vandals were largely ignored by the police, while peaceful protesters were targeted for beatings, tear gas, torture with pepper spray, and arrest.116 One New York Times article went so far as to claim that the Seattle protesters had thrown excrement, rocks, and Molotov cocktails at delegates and police officers; the Times later issued a correction acknowledging that these claims were false.117

Another striking application of the propaganda model can be seen in the media’s treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation. Because of the industry’s power, as well as the media’s receptivity to the demands of the business community, the media have normalized a system described by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring as “deliberately poisoning us, then policing the results.”129 Industry is permitted to produce and sell chemicals (and during the 1990s, bioengineered foods) without independent and prior proof of safety, and the “policing” by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been badly compromised by underfunding and political limits on both law enforcement and testing.130 A major National Research Council study of 1984 found that there was no health hazard data available for 78 percent of the chemicals in commerce, and an Environmental Defense Fund update found little change had occurred a dozen years later. The federal government’s National Toxicology Program tests about ten to twenty chemicals a year for carcinogenicity (but not for the numerous other possible adverse effects of chemicals); but meanwhile five hundred to a thousand new chemicals enter commerce annually, so our knowledge base steadily declines.131

Institutional critiques such as we present in this book are commonly dismissed by establishment commentators as “conspiracy theories,” but this is merely an evasion. We do not use any kind of “conspiracy” hypothesis to explain massmedia performance. In fact, our treatment is much closer to a “free market” analysis, with the results largely an outcome of the workings of market forces. Most biased choices in the media arise from the preselection of right-thinking people, internalized preconceptions, and the adaptation of personnel to the constraints of ownership, organization, market, and political power. Censorship is largely self-censorship, by reporters and commentators who adjust to the realities of source and media organizational requirements, and by people at higher levels within media organizations who are chosen to implement, and have usually internalized, the constraints imposed by proprietary and other market and governmental centers of power.

The mass media are not a solid monolith on all issues. Where the powerful are in disagreement, there will be a certain diversity of tactical judgments on how to attain generally shared aims, reflected in media debate. But views that challenge fundamental premises or suggest that the observed modes of exercise of state power are based on systemic factors will be excluded from the mass media even when elite controversy over tactics rages fiercely.

The public does not notice the silence on victims in client states, which is as important in supporting state policy as the concentrated focus on enemy victims. It would have been very difficult for the Guatemalan government to murder tens of thousands over the past decade if the U.S. press had provided the kind of coverage they gave to the difficulties of Andrei Sakharov or the murder of Jerzy Popieluszko in Poland (see chapter 2). It would have been impossible to wage a brutal war against South Vietnam and the rest of Indochina, leaving a legacy of misery and destruction that may never be overcome, if the media had not rallied to the cause, portraying murderous aggression as a defense of freedom, and only opening the doors to tactical disagreement when the costs to the interests they represent became too high.

Consider, for example, the extraordinary prominence in U.S. social science in the postwar period of two continental theorists: German sociologist Max Weber in the fifties and sixties, and French historian and social philosopher Michel Foucault ever since. Each attained a kind of intellectual hegemony in the United States that they never managed to achieve in their own countries. What made them so appealing to American academics? No doubt their popularity had much to do with the ease with which each could be adopted as a kind of anti-Marx, their theories put forth (usually in crudely simplified form) as ways of arguing that power is not simply or primarily a matter of the control of production but rather a pervasive, multifaceted, and unavoidable feature of any social life.

But I also think that a large part of the appeal was their attitude toward bureaucracy. Indeed, it sometimes seems that these were the only two intelligent human beings in twentieth century history who honestly believed that the power of bureaucracy lies in its effectiveness. That is, that bureaucracy really works. Weber saw bureaucratic forms of organization as the very embodiment of Reason in human affairs, so obviously superior to any alternative form of organization that they threatened to engulf everything, locking humanity in a joyless “iron cage,” bereft of spirit and charisma. Foucault was more subversive, but he was subversive in a way that only endowed bureaucratic power with more effectiveness, not less. In his work on asylums, clinics, prisons, and the rest, absolutely every aspect of human life—health, sexuality, work, morality, our very conceptions of truth—became nothing in and of themselves, but merely products of one or another form of professional or administrative discourse. Through concepts like governmentality and biopower, he argued that state bureaucracies end up shaping the parameters of human existence in ways far more intimate than anything Weber would have imagined. For Foucault, all forms of knowledge became forms of power, shaping our minds and bodies through largely administrative means.

It’s hard to avoid the suspicion that Weber and Foucault’s popularity owed much to the fact that the American university system during this period had itself increasingly become an institution dedicated to producing functionaries for an imperial administrative apparatus, operating on a global scale. In the immediate wake of World War II, when the United States was first establishing its global administrative apparatus, all this was often fairly explicit. Sociologists like Talcott Parsons and Edward Shils45 were deeply embedded in the Cold War establishment at Harvard, and the stripped-down version of Weber they created was quickly stripped down even further and adopted by State Department functionaries and the World Bank as “development theory,” and actively promoted as an alternative to Marxist historical materialism in the battleground states of the Global South. At that time, even anthropologists like Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Clifford Geertz had no compunctions against cooperating closely with the military-intelligence apparatus, or even the CIA.46 All this changed with the war in Vietnam. During the course of campus mobilizations against the war, this kind of complicity was thrown under a spotlight, and Parsons—and with him, Weber—came to be seen as the very embodiment of everything radicals sought to reject.

density, where our skills at interpretation are best deployed. We also have an increasing tendency to identify what’s interesting with what’s important, and to assume that places of density are also places of power. The power of bureaucracy shows just how often exactly the opposite is in fact the case. But this essay is not just—or not even primarily—about bureaucracy. It is primarily about violence. What I would like to argue is that situations created by violence—particularly structural violence, by which I mean forms of pervasive social inequality that are ultimately backed up by the threat of physical harm—invariably tend to create the kinds of willful blindness we normally associate with bureaucratic procedures. To put it crudely: it is not so much that bureaucratic procedures are inherently stupid, or even that they tend to produce behavior that they themselves define as stupid—though they do do that—but rather, that they are invariably ways of managing social situations that are already stupid because they are founded on structural violence. This approach, I think, has the potential to tell us a great deal about both how bureaucracy has come to pervade every aspect of our lives, and why we don’t notice it.

It is curious how rarely citizens in industrial democracies actually think about this fact, or how instinctively we try to discount its importance. This is what makes it possible, for example, for graduate students to be able to spend days in the stacks of university libraries poring over Foucault-inspired theoretical tracts about the declining importance of coercion as a factor in modern life without ever reflecting on that fact that, had they insisted on their right to enter the stacks without showing a properly stamped and validated ID, armed men would have been summoned to physically remove them, using whatever force might be required.

Let me take these points one at a time. Is it accurate to say that acts of violence are, generally speaking, also acts of communication? It certainly is. But this is true of pretty much any form of human action. It strikes me that what is really important about violence is that it is perhaps the only form of human action that holds out even the possibility of having social effects without being communicative.

These effects are often most visible when the structures of inequality take the most deeply internalized forms. Gender is again a classic case in point. For example, in American situation comedies of the 1950s, there was a constant staple: jokes about the impossibility of understanding women. The jokes (told, of course, by men) always represented women’s logic as fundamentally alien and incomprehensible. “You have to love them,” the message always seemed to run, “but who can really understand how these creatures think?” One never had the impression the women in question had any trouble understanding men. The reason is obvious. Women had no choice but to understand men. In America, the fifties were the heyday of a certain ideal of the one-income patriarchal family, and among the more affluent, the ideal was often achieved. Women with no access to their own income or resources obviously had no choice but to spend a great deal of time and energy understanding what their menfolk thought was going on.58

The second element is the resultant pattern of sympathetic identification. Curiously, it was Adam Smith, in his Theory of Moral Sentiments, who first observed the phenomenon we now refer to as “compassion fatigue.” Human beings, he proposed, are normally inclined not only to imaginatively identify with their fellows, but as a result, to spontaneously feel one another’s joys and sorrows. The poor, however, are so consistently miserable that otherwise sympathetic observers are simply overwhelmed, and are forced, without realizing it, to blot out their existence entirely. The result is that while those on the bottom of a social ladder spend a great deal of time imagining the perspectives of, and genuinely caring about, those on the top, it almost never happens the other way around. Whether one is dealing with masters and servants, men and women, employers and employees, rich and poor, structural inequality—what I’ve been calling structural violence—invariably creates highly lopsided structures of the imagination. Since I think Smith was right to observe that imagination tends to bring with it sympathy, the result is that victims of structural violence tend to care about its beneficiaries far more than those beneficiaries care about them. This might well be, after the violence itself, the single most powerful force preserving such relations.

Could it be possible to develop a general theory of interpretive labor? We’d probably have to begin by recognizing that there are two critical elements here that, while linked, need to be formally distinguished. The first is the process of imaginative identification as a form of knowledge, the fact that within relations of domination, it is generally the subordinates who are effectively relegated the work of understanding how the social relations in question really work.

If you think about it, this is a really ingenious trick. Because when most of us think about police, we do not think of them as enforcing regulations. We think of them as fighting crime, and when we think of “crime,” the kind of crime we have in our minds is violent crime.63 Even though, in fact, what police mostly do is exactly the opposite: they bring the threat of force to bear on situations that would otherwise have nothing to do with it.

places like small-town or rural Madagascar. So: Police are bureaucrats with weapons. If you think about it, this is a really ingenious trick. Because when most of us think about police, we do not think of them as enforcing regulations. We think of them as fighting crime, and when we think of “crime,” the kind of crime we have in our minds is violent crime.63 Even though, in fact, what police mostly do is exactly the opposite: they bring the threat of force to bear on situations that would otherwise have nothing to do with it.

I find this all the time in public discussions. When trying to come up with a hypothetical example of a situation in which police are likely to be involved, people will almost invariably think of some act of interpersonal violence: a mugging or assault. But even a moment’s reflection should make it clear that, when most real acts of physical assault do occur, even in major cities like Marseille or Montevideo or Minneapolis—domestic violence, gang fights, drunken brawls—the police do not get involved. Police are only likely to be called in if someone dies, or is so seriously hurt they end up in the hospital. But this is because the moment an ambulance is involved, there is also paperwork; if someone is treated in the hospital, there has to be a cause of injury, the circumstances become relevant, police reports have to be filed. And if someone dies there are all sorts of forms, up to and including municipal statistics. So the only fights which police are sure to get involved in are those that generate some kind of paperwork. The vast majority of muggings or burglaries aren’t reported either, unless there are insurance forms to be filled out, or lost documents that need to be replaced, and which can only be replaced if one files a proper police report. So most violent crime does not end up involving the police. On the other hand, try driving down the street of any one of those cities in a car without license plates. We all know what’s going to happen. Uniformed officers armed with sticks, guns, and/or tasers will appear on the scene almost immediately, and if you simply refuse to comply with their instructions, violent force will, most definitely, be applied.

The basic principle of structural analysis, I was explaining, is that the terms of a symbolic system do not stand in isolation—they are not to be thought of in terms of what they “stand for,” but are defined by their relations to each other. One has to first define the field, and then look for elements in that field that are systematic inversions of each other. Take vampires. First you place them: vampires are stock figures in American horror movies. American horror movies constitute a kind of cosmology, a universe unto themselves. Then you ask: what, within this cosmos, is the opposite of a vampire? The answer is obvious. The opposite of a vampire is a werewolf. On one level they are the same: they are both monsters that can bite you and by biting you, turn you, too, into one of their own kind. In most others ways each is an exact inversion of the other. Vampires are rich. They are typically aristocrats. Werewolves are always poor. Vampires are fixed in space: they have castles or crypts that they have to retreat to during the daytime; werewolves are usually homeless derelicts, travelers, or otherwise on the run. Vampires control other creatures (bats, wolves, humans that they hypnotize or render thralls.) Werewolves can’t control themselves. Yet—and this is really the clincher in this case—each can be destroyed only by its own negation: vampires, by a stake, a simple sharpened stick that peasants use to construct fences; werewolves, by a silver bullet, something literally made from money. By observing these axes of inversion, we can get a sense of what such symbols are really about: that vampires, for instance, are not necessarily so much about death, or fear, but about power; about the simultaneous feelings of attraction and repulsion that relations of domination tend to create.

Jim Cooper, a former LAPD officer turned sociologist,68 has observed that the overwhelming majority of those who end up getting beaten or otherwise brutalized by police turn out to be innocent of any crime. “Cops don’t beat up burglars,” he writes. The reason, he explained, is simple: the one thing most guaranteed to provoke a violent reaction from police is a challenge to their right to, as he puts it, “define the situation.”

Bureaucracies, I’ve suggested, are not themselves forms of stupidity so much as they are ways of organizing stupidity—of managing relationships that are already characterized by extremely unequal structures of imagination, which exist because of the existence of structural violence.

In the same way, when one takes a “realist” position in International Relations, one assumes that states will use whatever capacities they have at their disposal, including force of arms, to pursue their national interests. What “reality” is one recognizing? Certainly not material reality. The idea that nations are humanlike entities with purposes and interests is purely metaphysical. The King of France had purposes and interests. “France” does not. What makes it seem “realistic” to suggest it does is simply that those in control of nation-states have the power to raise armies, launch invasions, and bomb cities, and can otherwise threaten the use of organized violence in the name of what they describe as their “national interests”—and that it would be foolish to ignore that possibility. National interests are real because they can kill you.

This is why I say that the Left has always been, in its essential inspiration, antibureaucratic. Because it has always been founded on a different set of assumptions about what is ultimately real—that is, about the very grounds of political being. Obviously Leftists don’t deny the reality of violence. Many Leftist theorists think about it quite a lot. But they don’t tend to give it the same foundational status. Instead, I would argue that Leftist thought is founded on what I will call a “political ontology of the imagination” (though it could also, perhaps just as well, have been called an ontology of creativity or making or invention.)

Scientists investigate the nature of physical laws so as to understand the forces that govern the universe. Police are experts in the scientific application of physical force in order to enforce the laws that govern society. This is to my mind the essence of right-wing thought: a political ontology that through such subtle means allows violence to define the very parameters of social existence and common sense.70 This is why I say that the Left has always been, in its essential inspiration, antibureaucratic.

If artistic avant-gardes and social revolutionaries have felt a peculiar affinity for one another ever since, borrowing each other’s languages and ideas, it appears to have been insofar as both have remained committed to the idea that the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently. In this sense, a phrase like “all power to the imagination” expresses the very quintessence of the Left.

Such is the lesson, I think, for politics. If one resists the reality effect created by pervasive structural violence—the way that bureaucratic regulations seem to disappear into the very mass and solidity of the large heavy objects around us, the buildings, vehicles, large concrete structures, making a world regulated by such principles seem natural and inevitable, and anything else a dreamy fantasy—it is possible to give power to the imagination. But it also requires an enormous amount of work.

Jameson originally proposed the term “postmodernism” to refer to the cultural logic appropriate to a new phase of capitalism, one that Ernest Mandel had, as early as 1972, dubbed a “third technological revolution.” Humanity, Mandel argued, stood on the brink of a transformation as profound as the agricultural or industrial revolutions had been: one in which computers, robots, new energy sources, and new information technologies would, effectively, replace old-fashioned industrial labor—the “end of work” as it soon came to be called—reducing us all to designers and computer technicians coming up with the crazy visions that cybernetic factories would actually produce.81 End of work arguments became increasingly popular in the late seventies and early eighties, as radical thinkers pondered what would happen to traditional working-class struggle once there was no longer a working class. (The answer: it would turn into identity politics.)

At the same time, the U.S. government never did abandon gigantic state-controlled schemes of technological development. It just shifted their emphasis sharply away from civilian projects like the space program and in the direction of military research—not just Star Wars, which was Reagan’s version of a vast Soviet-scale project, but an endless variety of weapons projects, research in communications and surveillance technologies, and similar, “security-related” concerns. To some degree this had always been true: the billions poured into missile research alone had always dwarfed the relatively insignificant sums allocated to the space program. Yet by the 1970s, even much basic research came to be conducted following essentially military priorities. The most immediate reason we don’t have robot factories is that, for the last several decades, some 95 percent of robotics research funding has been channeled through the Pentagon, which is of course has far more interested in the kind of discoveries that might lead to the development of unmanned drones than fully automated bauxite mines or robot gardeners.

One might suggest an even darker possibility. A case could be made that even the shift into R&D on information technologies and medicine was not so much a reorientation towards market-driven consumer imperatives, but part of an all-out effort to follow the technological humbling of the Soviet Union with total victory in the global class war: not only the imposition of absolute U.S. military dominance overseas, but the utter rout of social movements back home. The technologies that emerged were in almost every case the kind that proved most conducive to surveillance, work discipline, and social control. Computers have opened up certain spaces of freedom, as we’re constantly reminded, but instead of leading to the workless utopia Abbie Hoffman or Guy Debord imagined, they have been employed in such a way as to produce the opposite effect. Information technology has allowed a financialization of capital that has driven workers ever more desperately into debt, while, at the same time, allowed employers to create new “flexible” work regimes that have destroyed traditional job security and led to a massive increase in overall working hours for almost all segments of the population. Along with the export of traditional factory jobs, this has put the union movement to rout and thus destroyed any real possibility of effective working-class politics.100 Meanwhile, despite unprecedented investment in research on medicine and life sciences, we still await cures for cancer or even of the common cold; instead, the most dramatic medical breakthroughs we have seen have taken the form of drugs like Prozac, Zoloft, or Ritalin—tailor-made, one might say, to ensure that these new professional demands don’t drive us completely, dysfunctionally, crazy.

In a fascinating book called Going Postal: Rage, Murder, and Rebellion from Reagan’s Workplaces to Clinton’s Columbine and Beyond, Mark Ames carefully picked through journalistic accounts of such events (which did, indeed, quickly spread from the Post Office to private offices and factories, and even to private postal services like UPS, but in the process, became so commonplace that many barely made the national news) and noted that the language they employ, which always described these events as acts of inexplicable individual rage and madness—severed from any consideration of the systematic humiliations that always seem to set them off—bears an uncanny resemblance to the way the nineteenth-century press treated slave revolts.126 Ames notes that there were remarkably few organized slave rebellions in American history. But there were a fair number of incidents in which individual slaves, or small groups, struck out in a similar fashion against overseers, masters, and their families with axes, knives, poison, or whatever means of immediate violence were at hand. In both cases, journalists treated such outbreaks as the result of either individual insanity, or inexplicable malice. In fact, to even suggest possible structural explanations—to speak of the evils of slavery, or to point out that before the eighties reforms in corporate culture that destroyed earlier assurances of secure lifetime employment and protections for workers against arbitrary and humiliating treatment by superiors, there had not been a single workplace massacre in all American history (other than by slaves)—seemed somehow immoral, since it would imply such violence was in some way justified.

Roman games provide an excellent example. Until the coming of the empire, most Mediterranean cities had had some form of self-governance, with public assemblies debating matters of public concern. In democracies, even legal cases were tried by public juries consisting of hundreds of citizens. Under the Empire, of course, these were stripped of all authority, and eventually disappeared. Instead, the main occasion when large numbers of citizens assembled in public was at the Coliseum or the Circus, for chariot races or gladiatorial games, or to watch criminals be torn to pieces by wild animals. Insofar as those citizens had any experience of voting for anything, it was to put their thumbs up or down over the question of whether some defeated gladiator would be put to death. In other words, the Empire not only justified itself largely by imposing a uniform system of law over its subjects, it also made a point of encouraging those subjects to form organized lynch mobs (the games were often sponsored by the very magistrates who presided over the courts), as if to say, “Democracy? Now you know where that will lead.” This was so effective that for the next two thousand years, warnings about the perils of democracy—and almost all educated Europeans for most of this period were staunchly opposed to democracy—insisted that “the people” in such a system would inevitably end up behaving like the mob at the Roman circus: riven by violent factionalism, careening irrationally between extremes of mercy and cruelty, between blindly following charismatic idols and destroying them again. And to this day, almost all educated people still feel that, even if they are willing to grudgingly accept a few democratic elements in some aspects of society, they need to be kept entirely separate from the administration of justice and the law.

But ultimately, sovereign power really is, still, the right to brush such legalities aside, or to make them up as one goes along.164 The United States might call itself “a country of laws, not men,” but as we have learned in recent years, American presidents can order torture, assassinations, domestic surveillance programs, even set up extra-legal zones like Guantanamo where they can treat prisoners pretty much any way they choose to. Even on the lowest levels, those who enforce the law are not really subject to it. It’s extraordinary difficult, for instance, for a police officer to do anything to an American citizen that would lead to that officer being convicted of a crime.165

This is, indeed, almost precisely what has happened wherever the republican form of government (now largely mislabeled “democracy”) has become the norm. The legal order, and hence the zones where state violence is the ultimate enforcer of the rules, has expanded to define and regulate almost every possible aspect of human activity. Thus, as I’ve said earlier, we end up with regulations prescribing everything from where one can serve or consume different sorts of beverages, how one can work, when one can and can’t walk off from work, to the size of advertisements visible from the street. The threat of force invades practically every aspect of our existence, in ways that would have simply been inconceivable under the rule of Elagabalus, Genghis Khan or Suleiman the Magnificent.

I’ve already written about this invasion of regulation, and violence, into every aspect of our lives. What I want to argue here is that this imperative ultimately derives from a tacit cosmology in which the play principle (and by extension, creativity) is itself seen as frightening, while game-like behavior is celebrated as transparent and predictable, and where as a result, the advance of all these rules and regulations is itself experienced as a kind of freedom.

Call it the grammar-book effect. People do not invent languages by writing grammars, they write grammars—at least, the first grammars to be written for any given language—by observing the tacit, largely unconscious, rules that people seem to be applying when they speak. Yet once a book exists, and especially once it is employed in schoolrooms, people feel that the rules are not just descriptions of how people do talk, but prescriptions for how they should talk.

We don’t know of a single recorded example of a language that, over the course of, say, a century, did not change both in sound and structure.169 This is true even of the languages of the most “traditional” societies; it happens even where elaborate institutional structures have been created—like grammar schools, or the Académie Française—to ensure that it does not. No doubt some of this is the result of sheer rebelliousness (young people trying to set themselves off from elders, for example) but it’s hard to escape the conclusion that ultimately, what we are really confronting here is the play principle in its purest form. Human beings, whether they speak Arapesh, Hopi, or Norwegian, just find it boring to say things the same way all the time. They’re always going to play around at least a little. And this playing around will always have cumulative effects.

But in this particular case, and in this larger political-economic context, where bureaucracy has been the primary means by which a tiny percentage of the population extracts wealth from the rest of us, they have created a situation where the pursuit of freedom from arbitrary power simply ends up producing more arbitrary power, and as a result, regulations choke existence, armed guards and surveillance cameras appear everywhere, science and creativity are smothered, and all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our day taken up in the filling out of forms.

Almost never do superheroes make, create, or build anything. The villains, in contrast, are relentlessly creative. They are full of plans and projects and ideas. Clearly, we are supposed to first, without consciously realizing it, identify with the villains. After all, they’re having all the fun. Then of course we feel guilty for it, reidentify with the hero, and have even more fun watching the Superego pummel the errant Id back into submission.

In Athens, nowadays, there’s active collaboration between the crime bosses in poor immigrant neighborhoods, fascist gangs, and the police. In fact, in this case it was clearly a political strategy: faced with the prospect of popular uprisings against a right-wing government, the police first withdrew protection from neighborhoods near the immigrant gangs, then started giving tacit support to the fascists (the result was the rapid rise of an overtly Nazi party. Roughly half of Greek police were reported to have voted for the Nazis in the last election). But this is just how far-right politics work. For them, it is in that space where different violent forces operating outside of the legal order (or in the case of the police, sometimes just barely inside it) inter-act where new forms of power, hence order, can emerge.

It’s more that both fascism and superheroes were products of a similar historical predicament: What is the foundation of social order when one has exorcised the very idea of revolution? And above all, what happens to the political imagination? One might begin here by considering who are the core audience for superhero comics. Mainly, adolescent or preadolescent white boys. That is, individuals who are at a point in their lives where they are likely to be both maximally imaginative and at least a little bit rebellious; but who are also being groomed to eventually take on positions of authority and power in the world, to be fathers, sheriffs, small-business owners, middle managers, engineers. And what do they learn from these endless repeated dramas? Well, first off, that imagination and rebellion lead to violence; second, that, like imagination and rebellion, violence is a lot of fun; third, that, ultimately, violence must be directed back against any overflow of imagination and rebellion lest everything go askew. These things must be contained! This is why insofar as superheroes are allowed to be imaginative in any way, it could only be extended to the design of their clothes, their cars, maybe their homes, their various accessories.

In fact, none of the villains in any of the three movies wants to rule the world. They don’t wish to have power over others, or to create new rules of any sort. Even their henchmen are temporary expedients—they always ultimately plan to kill them. Nolan’s villains are always anarchists. But they’re also always very peculiar anarchists, of a sort that seem to exist only in the filmmaker’s imagination: anarchists who believe that human nature is fundamentally evil and corrupt.

The problem with this vision of politics is that it simply isn’t true. Politics is not just the art of manipulating images, backed up by violence. It’s not really a duel between impresarios before an audience that will believe most anything if presented artfully enough. No doubt it must seem that way to extraordinarily wealthy Hollywood film directors. But between the shooting of the first and second movies, history intervened quite decisively to point out just how wrong this vision is. The economy collapsed. Not because of the manipulations of some secret society of warrior monks, but because a bunch of financial managers who, living in Nolan’s bubble world, shared his assumptions about the endlessness of popular manipulability, turned out to be wrong. There was a mass popular response. It did not take the form of a frenetic search for messianic saviors, mixed with outbreaks of nihilist violence;172 increasingly, it took the form of a series of real popular movements, even revolutionary movements, toppling regimes in the Middle East and occupying squares everywhere from Cleveland to Karachi, trying to create new forms of democracy.

These examinations into popular culture pave the way for a larger examination into the predominant ideological orientation of the current moment, what I call, following Alex Williams, “negative solidarity.”8 Negative solidarity is not just an inversion of solidarity, a focus on the individual rather than the collective, but one in which any collectivity, any connection between one individual’s struggles and another’s, is actively refused. Negative solidarity is a transformation of one’s own particular destitution into a virtue—a virtue that is founded upon an attachment to the trials and tribulations of work. It is the belief that because one has suffered through work, or believes that they have suffered, then others should too. Any attempt to improve one’s conditions is seen as a betrayal of the validity of one’s suffering.

“This apparently transhistorical necessity—that the individual’s labor is the necessary means to their (or their family’s) consumption—serves as the basis for a fundamental legitimating ideology of the capitalist social formation as a whole, throughout its various cases.”9 The specific socioeconomic necessity of working in order to procure commodities is given the veneer of an anthropological, or even biological, necessity of survival.

it is worth emphasizing a seemingly mundane, but incredibly significant fact: there is no temporal or spatial indicator of this division between necessary and surplus labor. There is no bell that sounds, nor any announcement which states, “Attention, workers: you have made your wages. The rest of the working day is surplus.” Such an announcement would invariably lead to revolution, or, at the very least, mass walk-offs. The difference between the cost of labor power and its productivity, a difference foundational to capital, is obscured by the wage that presents labor power as a commodity paid for like any other. The wage relation is both the economic basis of capitalism and the kernel of its ideological justification in that it conceals exploitation behind the exchange of wages for labor.

We are at a ‘turning point in world history’, they write, with Russia’s aggression in Ukraine marking ‘both the consolidation of the West and the emergence of the long-heralded post-Western international order’.1 To express it differently, what is emerging amid systemic chaos and war is a world ‘order’ in which the ‘West’ is just one part, however mighty and wealthy, and not the universal actor orchestrating some kind of liberal rules-based international order.

Public-television station WNET lost its corporate funding from Gulf + Western in 1985 after the station showed the documentary “Hungry for Profit,” which contains material critical of multinational corporate activities in the Third World. Even before the program was shown, in anticipation of negative corporate reaction, station officials “did all we could to get the program sanitized” (according to one station source).53 The chief executive of Gulf + Western complained to the station that the program was “virulently anti-business if not anti-American,” and that the station’s carrying the program was not the behavior “of a friend” of the corporation. The London Economist says that “Most people believe that WNET would not make the same mistake again.”54

Further, the cotton that goes into the clothing produced in Bangladesh is cultivated by poor farmers in India working in oppressive 104°F+ heat.9 Ever-increasing demand from the fashion industry has led to the widespread use of genetically modified cotton plants. As a result, farmers lose possession of their own seeds and are forced instead to borrow money to purchase genetically modified ones, along with chemical fertilizer and pesticides, every year. When crops fail due to drought or heat waves, the farmers end up accumulating more and more debt, and it’s not uncommon for this to drive them to suicide.

Marx’s main point was this: capitalism displaces its contradictions elsewhere and thus renders them invisible. This displacement only makes the contradictions worsen, deepening the quagmire into an increasingly disastrous state of affairs. Capital’s attempts to displace its ill effects can only result in collapse. According to Marx, this is the ultimate, insurmountable limit of capital.

However, history shows that the depletion of soil did not lead to the civilizational crisis Liebig foretold. Why not? One answer is the discovery of the Haber-Bosch process by which ammonia can be created industrially, a discovery that allowed large amounts of chemical fertilizer to be made at a low price. But this discovery did not in fact heal the rift produced by the contradictions of capital. It merely displaced its effects. The Haber-Bosch process produces ammonia (NH3) not just by using nitrogen (N) from the air but also hydrogen (H) extracted from fossil fuels (primarily natural gas). This of course means that a huge amount of fossil fuels are needed to satisfy the fertilizing needs of the world’s farmland. Indeed, the amount of natural gas used to create ammonia this way constitutes 3–5 percent of the world’s total output.19 In other words, modern agriculture replaces the original nutrients in the soil by using up another nonrenewable natural resource. And of course, the production process also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is the fundamental nature of the contradictions produced by technological shift.

The problem is that according to Rockström’s calculations, four planetary boundaries, including climate change and loss of biodiversity, have already been exceeded due to human economic activity.30 This is a well-demonstrated fact. As a result of humanity’s attempts to conquer nature, the Earth’s environment has undergone major irreversible changes already. This has placed humanity on a path toward a critically dangerous point after which nothing can be done. Is this a situation in which the “green economic growth” promoted by “green Keynesianism” should really be our goal? I want to draw attention to one of Rockström’s newspaper articles, which he published in 2019. The title of this article, published ten years after the presentation of the planetary boundaries paradigm, is provocative: “Green Growth Is Wishful Thinking: We Must Act.”31

Capitalism is always trying to raise workforce productivity in order to cut costs. Rises in workforce productivity allow the same amount of production to occur with fewer workers. When this happens, the economy’s size remains constant while unemployment rates rise. But capitalism also makes it impossible for the unemployed to live, and politicians hate high unemployment rates. For this reason, there’s a huge amount of pressure for the economy to keep expanding indefinitely so as to maintain the rate of employment. This is why a rise in productivity results in the expansion of the economy. This is the Productivity Trap. Capitalism cannot escape the Productivity Trap, which means it cannot wean itself off its dependence on economic growth.

Again, though, looking at things on a global scale, emissions are still going up due to the rapid economic growth occurring in emerging nations. So the reality is that even as some carbon dioxide emissions are decreasing as a result of absolute decoupling, overall emissions are still on the rise. This data conforms to what we’ve already seen (see Figure 2). Overall, the worldwide volume of carbon dioxide emissions is rising by about 2.6 percent every year. Even emissions in the US are rising at a yearly rate of 1.6 percent.35 It’s simply not realistic to think that the sufficient absolute decoupling needed to reach the under 28.4°F mark will happen if things continue this way. This is why Jackson concludes that decoupling is a “myth” and criticizes the arguments of those promoting green economic growth as “totally unconvincing.”

Rather, the drop in the price of coal due to how little was now needed resulted in it being used in all sorts of ways it hadn’t been before, leading to an overall increase in its consumption.

In places where households typically possess multiple cars and trucks, the result would still be unsustainable even if every single one were replaced by an electric vehicle. Furthermore, the planned rollout by Ford and Tesla of SUV-style electric vehicles signals nothing more than the continued strengthening of our present culture of consumption, which will only lead to an increased waste of resources.

Stiglitz rejects faith in the free market, stating that raising workers’ wages and additional taxation of the superrich and major industry, along with stricter prohibitions on monopolies, are necessary to bring about a just capitalist society.68 If democratic elections were to change laws and policies along these lines, then economic growth could be revived, and a “progressive” capitalism in which the average person would belong to a comfortable middle class might be possible. Can capitalism really be tamed by changing laws and policies? This is the crux of Žižek’s skepticism. If increases in taxation, including corporate taxes, and social welfare spending were possible to bring about via elections, why hasn’t it already happened? When profit rates in the 1970s fell, plunging capitalism into a very serious crisis, various regulations were quickly jettisoned and taxes were lowered right away. If regulations were put back in place at the same level as they were then or even a higher level, wouldn’t capitalism just collapse again? In any case, it would never accept this sort of restriction on its functioning—it would oppose it at every turn. Capitalists have the power to exert enormous amounts of political pressure, not just by threatening to move factories overseas but to sell government bonds and cause stock prices to fall precipitously.

In the late nineteenth century, the German postal service was considered one of the great wonders of the modern world. Its efficiency was so legendary, in fact, that it casts a kind of terrible shadow across the twentieth century. Many of the greatest achievements of what we now call “high modernism” were inspired by—or in many cases, built in direct imitation of—the German Post Office. And one could indeed make a case that many of the most terrible woes of that century can also be laid at its feet. To understand how this could be, we need to understand a little of the real origins of the modern social welfare state, which we now largely think of—when we think of them at all—as having been created by benevolent democratic elites. Nothing could be further from the truth. In Europe, most of the key institutions of what later became the welfare state—everything from social insurance and pensions to public libraries and public health clinics—were not originally created by governments at all, but by trade unions, neighborhood associations, cooperatives, and working-class parties and organizations of one sort or another. Many of these were engaged in a self-conscious revolutionary project of “building a new society in the shell of the old,” of gradually creating Socialist institutions from below. For some it was combined with the aim of eventually seizing control of the government through parliamentary means, for others, it was a project in itself. One must remember that during the late nineteenth century, even the direct heirs of Marx’s Communist Party had largely abandoned the idea of seizing control of the government by force, since this no longer seemed necessary; in a Europe at peace and witnessing rapid technological progress, they felt that it should be possible to create a social revolution through peaceful, electoral means.

social security originated as part of a series of efforts people made to provide each other with things necessary to live good lives without relying on the market. What happened in the twentieth century was the systematization of these efforts by the welfare state. London School of Economics professor and cultural anthropologist David Graeber explains it this way: In Europe, most of the key institutions of what later became the welfare state—everything from social insurance and pensions to public libraries and public health clinics—were not originally created by governments at all, but by trade unions, neighborhood associations, cooperatives, and working-class parties and organizations of one kind or another. Many of these were engaged in a self-conscious revolutionary project of “building a new society in the shell of the old,” of gradually creating Socialist institutions from below.76 Graeber is explaining how the commons formed out of free association were systematized under capitalism into the welfare state. But starting at the end of the 1980s, neoliberal austerity measures dismantled or weakened associations like labor unions and public health services one after another, allowing these commons to be swallowed by the market.

Capitalism, he thought, might bring about the exploitation of workers and the destruction of the environment for a time. But it would also bring about innovation through competition that would raise productivity. This rise in productivity would prepare the conditions for everyone in the future society to enjoy a rich, free lifestyle. Let’s call this way of thinking the progressive view of history. According to the most widespread understanding of Marx, he was a classic proponent of seeing history as progress. Furthermore, this view displays two distinctive features: productivism and Eurocentrism.

Fraas’s book, Climate and the Vegetable World throughout the Ages, a History of Both, describes the process by which various ancient civilizations fell, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece, among others. According to Fraas, a common reason all these civilizations collapsed was a change in climate caused by overharvesting forestland, which made the cultivation of the land more and more difficult. Those regions are arid these days, but this was not always the case. Large amounts of fertile land were lost to the overdevelopment of the natural world.

He was also worried about the danger of capitalism’s drive to develop logging and transportation technologies, which would only further extend humanity’s incursion into the world’s forests.

The most famous critique in this regard comes from the world’s foremost postcolonial scholar, Palestinian American professor Edward Said. Said calls Marx an Orientalist—a European who sees non-Europeans as lesser and primitive: In article after article, he returned with increasing conviction to the idea that even in destroying Asia, Britain was making possible there a real social revolution … Marx’s humanity, his sympathy for the misery of people, are clearly engaged. Yet in the end it is a Romantic Orientalist vision that wins out. Said thus concludes that ultimately, “Marx’s economic analyses are perfectly fitted … to a standard Orientalist undertaking.”

These writings are why University of California sociologist Kevin Anderson asserts that the late Marx embraced a multilinear historical view, refusing to “bind himself to a single model of development or revolution” dependent on a unilinear view of history as progress.91 The road to socialism is thus unbound from the developmental model of Western Europe. Rather, Marx concludes that the search for methods for transitioning to a communist society must include the thorough study of the complexities and differences in the histories and social systems of non-Western societies. Marx’s Eurocentric view of history as progress thus ends up replaced by one that focuses on non-Western societies, actively praising the communal forms found in them. And if this is true, then Said’s criticism of Marx as an Orientalist is no longer sustainable.

The idea is that if production increases exponentially, the prices of things will continue to drop until we reach a “luxury economy” unbound by natural restrictions, not even those of monetary currency. This is the “fully automated luxury communism” Bastani proposes. It’s a future in which no one has to worry about environmental issues any longer and can instead make use of their fortunes freely and without consequences. This is, according to Bastani, the ultimate expression of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”—the ultimate form of the communism envisioned by Marx.

Furthermore, the “folk” opinions of the common citizen become suppressed by the authority of experts. The top-down reforms instituted by the politicalists may seem efficient at first glance, but the wages of this efficiency can be seen in the narrowing of the field of democratic participation and the damage done to the sense of agency felt by those who do participate.

A unique feature of a citizens’ assembly is the method by which members are chosen. Rather than elections, a lottery system is used. This is a decisive difference from a parliament or congress made up of elected officials. Of course, this lottery system isn’t completely random—the makeup of each assembly is meant to reflect the makeup of its community as closely as possible in terms of age, gender identity, educational background, residency, and so on.

Let’s now take a closer look at the scarcity created through the dissolution of the commons. Once deprived of the commons, we’re thrown into a world of commodities. The first thing we face there is the scarcity of money. The world is overflowing with commodities. But without money, we cannot buy them. Money will allow us to buy anything, but the methods for attaining money are very restricted, leading to impoverishment. Therefore, we must chase money as hard as we can just to survive. We once worked for a few hours a day and then, once our needs were met, spent the rest of the day at leisure. We napped, played, talked to each other.128 These days, though, we are forced to work long hours at the behest of another just to receive a little money. Time has become money. Which means time has become scarce—we cannot afford to waste even a minute of it, not even a second. Marx frequently referred to the conditions of labor under capitalism as slavery.129 Workers are like slaves in the sense that they must work and work without breaks, irrespective of their will. Modern workers are infinitely replaceable under capitalism. Once fired, workers face starvation and even death if they cannot find new jobs. Marx called this form of precariousness “absolute poverty.”130 It’s an expression that contains in concentrated form the essence of capitalism as a system that produces perpetual meagerness and scarcity. To translate it into the terms of the argument contained in this book, poverty is caused by absolute scarcity.

These examples speak volumes—as a crisis worsens, the state is called upon by specialists and experts to regulate the lives of citizens more and more invasively, a violation of individual freedom that citizens largely accept.

Yet even Piketty stops short of explicitly endorsing degrowth. Even as he calls for participatory socialism, he envisions the transition as relying in large part on taxation—that is, on the power of the state. This is a problem. The more a state attempts to control capital through taxation, the more its power grows, sliding inexorably toward a form of state socialism I previously identified as climate Maoism. In this way, the system ends up moving away from Marx’s degrowth communism.

The true form of Marx’s thought can be organized into five main points. These points are: 1) the transition to an economy based on use-value; 2) the shortening of work hours; 3) the abolition of the uniform division of labor; 4) the democratization of the production process; and finally, 5) the prioritization of essential work.

The important thing, from Marx’s point of view later in life, is that democratizing the production process would go hand in hand with decelerating the economy. Democratizing the production process means the communal management of the means of production through free association—in other words, deciding democratically what and how much should be produced, and how. Opinions on these matters will naturally differ sometimes, and consensus building in an environment free of authoritarian force takes time. One of the decisive changes social ownership brings about is a deceleration of decision making.

Where we do discuss race in public, we have been trained to see racism – if we see it at all – as an issue of interpersonal morality. Good people are not racist, only bad people are. This neat binary is a great way of avoiding any real discussion at all. But without the structural violence of unequal treatment before the law and in education, and a history of racial exploitation by states, simple acts of personal prejudice would have significantly less meaning. In short, we are trained to recognise the kinds of racism that tend to be engaged in by poorer people.

For example, my aforementioned gangster uncles universally encouraged me to stay in school, paid me pocket money for reciting the theory of evolution to them as a child and even threatened to give me a bloody good hiding if I tried to be like them – i.e. a criminal. My good friend, a retired Premier League footballer from the notorious Stonebridge estate, was officially banned from the ‘front line’ by all the drug dealers in ‘the ends’ when he was growing up. They saw his potential, his chance for a life different to their own, and these ‘bad’ people – I am not denying that they were indeed hardened criminals – protected him and me.

Remember the tens of thousands of white parents – often stigmatised single mothers – from poor areas of the UK who were coerced by the state into sending their children to Australia right up until the 1970s? These children were frequently victims of sexual abuse, hard labour and even flogging. We would call this child trafficking if it had been done by a non-Western state.1 British Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised for the programme in 2010, as did Australian PM Kevin Rudd the year before, though naturally the widespread abuse of black children in the care system, prisons, police cells and mental asylums of this country occurring at the exact same time will have to wait for some more years before it is officially recognised and atoned for, if ever.

So, if whiteness really is a metaphor for power, how is that power actually exercised? Theodore W. Allen’s meticulous study The Invention of the White Race, which took over a decade to produce, observes that in the first two generations of census data in the Virginia colonies there were no humans defined as white; the people we now think of as white were at that point still predominantly defined by other factors, such as the region of Europe from which they came. He argues that the ancestors of European Americans started to be defined as ‘white’ in response to labour solidarity between African- and European-American bondservants, especially after Bacon’s Rebellion of 1696, a multi-racial rebellion against British governor William Berkely. European ruling elites began doling out privileges, like the right to bear arms or certain privileged positions within the plantation economy, based on skin colour, or rather on ‘whiteness’ such as the Virginia slave codes of 1705 that made it illegal to whip a white Christian slave naked or for a black person to employ or own a white person. The act also fined white women for having bastard children with negroes or mulattoes, made racial intermarriage punishable by imprisonment and made it legal for a master to kill his slave.2 As indentured servitude turned to chattel slavery and slavery came to be reserved strictly for people of African heritage, this white privilege became all the more important, as it literally became the difference between still being a human being and becoming a piece of property.

Many of the most celebrated intellectual icons of the last few centuries, from Jefferson, Roosevelt and Wilson to Lincoln, Kant, Hume, Churchill, Hugo, Hegel and many more otherwise intelligent and in some cases very brilliant people, openly espoused their belief in innate white supremacy, so it is rather odd that we are so squeamish about the phrase now. Even stranger that we are trained to think of white supremacy as the invention of some supposedly obscure hooded lunatics in the American South. This belies reality, first in that the KKK at their height had many millions of members, and second because, as shown above, white supremacy was a mainstream and openly espoused legal, political and moral imperative until the latter half of the twentieth century, so hardly ancient or remote history.

During the 1960s, remnants of eugenics-inspired assumptions about students’ natural abilities were still all the rage – schools for the ‘Mentally Subnormal’ (MSN) had simply been rebranded with the slightly more palatable title of schools for the ‘Educationally Sub Normal’ (ESN). These were schools outside of the official system where apparently difficult students, those with ‘special needs’ or those with learning difficulties, were dumped. Unsurprisingly, black children were found to be massively over-represented in these ESN schools in relation to the percentage they made up of the population as a whole. As a response to this reality, Grenadian scholar Bernard Coard set about publishing the now legendary ‘How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System’ to expose the scandal of systemic discrimination in British schools.5 The pamphlet was published by a small independent black publishing company and sold all 10,000 copies of its initial run and actually received generally favourable press at the time of publication in 1971. The reaction of the establishment was of course to deny the truths set out by Coard – before eventually admitting he was in fact correct – but more shockingly to tap his phone and have the police threaten his nephew, such is the weaponised history of black education in Britain.6

Fast forward to 9 August 2012; I sat down to watch the men’s 200 metres final at the London Olympics. Usain Bolt had already won the 100 metres a few days earlier and it looked set to be another year of dominance for him and for Jamaica; like all British Jamaicans and sprint fans everywhere, I was very excited. Then something very strange happened. For who knows what reason, the BBC decided to play a weird eugenics film just before the final. The commentator who was sat next to a trio of black track legends, Colin Jackson, Michael Johnson and Denise Lewis, introduced the film in the following way:   As we build up to the 200 metres, and this is a subject that doesn’t get raised very often, because it just doesn’t, but the fact is that not a single white athlete has contested the men’s 100 metres final in the Olympics for thirty-two years. Eighty-two people have broken ten seconds for 100 metres and eighty-one of them have been black; the only one who is white is Christophe Lemaitre of France, who is running tonight in the 200 metres final. In fact, only four white men have ever gone under twenty seconds for 200 metres. So it brings the whole issue of nature or nurture into very sharp focus.   There are a number of obvious problems and lapses in basic logic within this statement. First, almost 40 per cent of the men on Earth are from India and China – not to mention the rest of the non-white but not-black world – yet whoever wrote this script seems entirely unconcerned with their lack of presence in Olympic sprint finals.

An estimated 12 million Africans at the very least were transported in floating dungeons across the Atlantic from the mid-fifteenth to nineteenth centuries; countless numbers of them died en route to the African coast, and also during the horrendous middle passage. The idea that black Africans were savage heathens, and thus slavery was a good and necessary stage in preparing them for civilisation, became so embedded in Euro-Christian thought that even some abolitionists accepted and parroted the idea. However, even as late as the mid-eighteenth century, it was still rare for a European observer, even those heavily involved with slavery on the African coast, to assert that black people were not human.9 Inferior perhaps, heathens for sure, but up until this point the humanity of Africans had rarely been questioned. This may seem strange given the inhumane treatment intrinsic to enslavement, but again we must realise that inhumane treatment of the lower orders was the norm in Europe at this time; in Britain, for example, poor people were still regularly hanged for small property theft, or transported to Australia in horrendous conditions and violently ejected from their lands so that those lands could be enclosed in a manner that would be repeated in the settler colonies of the future. Though, of course, the dehumanisation of anti-black racism gave transatlantic chattel slavery a particular sadism. The turning point towards a ‘scientific’ and systematic racism came when writers like Edward Long, a British-Jamaican slave owner, started to justify the plantation regime on the grounds that black people were not just inferior but that they were not even human.10

While some scholars have taken to locating the origins of anti-black racism in the plantation economies of the Americas or as a simple by-product of capitalist greed, it seems more accurate to say that the prejudices that made New World slavery’s exclusively anti-black nature possible had much deeper roots in European history and culture, and had long precedents in other regions of the world, most notably the Middle East and North Africa.15 As slavery continues in northern Africa today and as barely disguised semi-slavery continues in the prisons of the United States, the legacies of the invention of blackness are all too apparent and alive, from the Brazilian favela to the Johannesburg slum.

Once the French realised, as predicted at the time by British abolitionist James Stephen (and by the Haitians themselves), that the Haitians could not be re-enslaved, the French plan was to exterminate them all and start over again with newly enslaved people brought from Africa. The war that ensued became an explicitly genocidal one, in which the French troops were instructed to exterminate all of the blacks on the island.9 This extermination attempt included the massacre of families and surrendered soldiers, the elderly and the sick, but the French also excelled themselves in the range of human barbarities they introduced with this war. These included turning ships into gas chambers, mass drowning – Toussaint L’Ouverture’s brother and his family died this way – and importing thousands of dogs from Cuba that had been trained to eat people. None of this savagery cowed the Haitians, rather it appears to have only emboldened them; French soldiers and observers have left many terrified records from the period.

After independence, Haiti was afflicted by a series of fratricidal wars between the victorious revolutionaries that often had a racial overtone to them – blacks vs. mulattoes – and the legacy of that colour-based, slave-era privilege still afflicts every former slave colony to this day. The USA then invaded Haiti in 1915, removing the stipulation in the Haitian constitution that prevented foreign whites from owning land there, killing 15,000 Haitians and backing a brutal dictatorship for the best part of the twentieth century, and then, when Haiti finally went to the polls, the USA collaborated with the Haitian elite to have their democratically elected leader overthrown, twice.11 To my knowledge, no senior British government official uttered even so much as a word in protest about any of this, though we can all be sure they would have found their moral indignation about ‘human rights’ if Russia or Iran had been the culprits.

Africa had and has ethnic, cultural, class and imperial rivalries that every scholar of the period acknowledges are the very divisions that colonisers and slave traders played on. In fact, as the award-winning historian Sylviane A. Diouf notes, in none of the slave narratives that have survived do the formerly enslaved talk about being sold by other ‘Africans’, or by ‘their own people’ and only Sancho – who lived in England – even mentions the ‘blackness’ of those that sold him.17 The victims of the transatlantic traffic did not think that they were being sold out by their ‘black brothers and sisters’ any more than the Irish thought that their ‘white brothers and sisters’ from England were deliberately starving them to death during the famine.

However, perhaps the most neglected area of study in the whole history of transatlantic slavery is the issue of resistance to enslavement in Africa itself. Most people are at least vaguely aware that there was some resistance from black people in the Caribbean but it’s always fascinated me that people, even many in the black diaspora, seem willing to believe that ‘Africans’ – undifferentiated by class, region or ethnicity – just allowed their family members to be taken away, or worse, that they were all collaborators. Thanks to decades of painstaking research we know this is fundamentally untrue. There were literally hundreds of rebellions and attacks against slave ships up and down the West African coast carried out by organised guerrilla groups much like the Maroons of the Caribbean. As many as 483 of these rebellions are recorded in British, French and Dutch records alone. The average death toll in these skirmishes seems to have been about twenty-five and the historian David Richardson estimates that a million fewer people had to go through the middle passage because of this one form of resistance alone.21 It is also estimated that one in every ten European slave ships to dock in West Africa experienced either a ship-board revolt or an attack from land.

Britons were submitted to generations of deliberate imperialist, militarist propaganda in all areas of culture, from education to the cinema, theatre and music halls and in the production of huge imperial exhibitions at Wembley and elsewhere.24 The myopia this propaganda still produces was aptly captured when Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox said in 2016, in the run-up to the EU referendum, that ‘the United Kingdom is one of the few countries in the European Union that does not need to bury its twentieth-century history.’ Funny, because Britain is in fact one of the few countries in the world that literally did bury a good portion of its twentieth-century history. During the period of decolonisation, the British state embarked upon a systematic process of destroying the evidence of its crimes. Codenamed ‘Operation Legacy’, the state intelligence agencies and the Foreign Office conspired to literally burn, bury at sea or hide vast amounts of documents containing potentially sensitive details of things done in the colonies under British rule.25

So while violence of the organised-crime and teenage-gang varieties has been with us for some time and continues to affect regions of the country where very few black people live at all, if you live in London and read the London press, you’d be forgiven for thinking that a) black boys are the only demographic that have ever been affected by this issue and b) London is one of the most violent cities in the world. In reality, class is a far bigger factor than race in this issue and, as noted above, London is not even the most dangerous area of Britain, let alone Europe, let alone the world. So while my narrative in this chapter will focus on working-class black boys in London, that is much more a result of proximity and familiarity than because I’m adopting the silly and obviously racist ‘black-on-black violence’ narrative so loved by US and UK media and law enforcement. We will deal with the ‘black-on-black violence’ trope later, but for now it’s enough to note that even in London, when you adjust for class, the ‘ethnic model’ of explaining street crime falls away entirely.5 It’s also important to note that while London feels incredibly dangerous for teenagers it remains, in reality, a far safer city than media hysteria would have you believe, and the vast majority of murders in the city are committed by adults, not teenagers.

When viewed in the historical context that governments themselves evolved as governments for the wealthy, explicitly excluding the poor, and that it took literally centuries of struggle for people who were not ‘propertied’ to have the right to vote and therefore any say in political affairs, all of this makes perfect and simple sense. Marx and his intellectual descendants may well prove to have been wrong about socialism and how society will evolve – we’ll see – but much of their analysis of the way capitalism works is so clearly and plainly accurate that if it was given to any working-class child at school they would immediately be able to make total sense of much of the ‘Marxist nonsense’, as it’s so often called.

From 1986 to 1990, activists in the UK organised a non-stop picket outside the South African embassy in London. The response of the state was to arrest activists and try to ban the protest. Think about that; the British government having its own citizens arrested for protesting a foreign racist settler regime. It seems that large sections of the British public have long been more forward thinking than those in power.

From his release from prison until his death, Mandela became a virtual saint in the mainstream media, an elder uncle to our broken world, praised by everyone from Bill Clinton to the Pope. When Mandela died, the Daily Mail ran with the headline ‘Death of a Colossus’, Downing Street flew the flag at half-mast and then Prime Minster David Cameron called Mandela ‘a true global hero’. Statues of Mandela now stand outside of the Southbank Centre and even in Parliament Square – along with two of the architects of apartheid, Winston Churchill and Jan Smuts.

After the apartheid handover, the South African central bank was to be run by the same man it was run by under apartheid. The apartheid-era finance minister also kept his position. The debts incurred by the apartheid regime had to be paid off by the newly elected ANC and the ANC essentially accepted the IMF/World Bank neocolonial model that has been such a disaster for other poor countries. A newly elected black government paying back loans taken out with international creditors by a white supremacist regime; it would be laughable if its effects were not so sickening. I’m not sure there has ever been a clearer case of odious debt in history. No corporation was forced to pay reparations to the victims of murders and other abuses carried out under apartheid to benefit them. Killers and torturers were not imprisoned, as would be usual after a regime ‘fell’, but rather were invited to confess their crimes and walk free. To this day, South African whites, who are still a small minority, control a hugely disproportionate amount of all forms of capital in South Africa.

In addition to playing such a significant role in the ending of apartheid, Cuba has managed to avoid the ravages that drug trafficking wrought on the rest of the region. The murder rate in Cuba is four times lower than the average for Latin America, or to put it another way, the murder rate in many US cities is ten times worse than the murder rate in Cuba. The same is true in relation to nearby Jamaica, and South Africa frequently ranks in the top ten for murder rate in the world. The kinds of massacres of workers that occurred at Sharpeville and Marikana simply have not occurred in post-1959 Cuba, and even the most ardent anti-Cuba ideologues could not try and pretend that the kind of police brutality that is so common in South Africa, Jamaica, Brazil and even the USA exists on anything like that scale in Cuba. The extreme inequality and particular history that makes Latin America the most violent region of the world is due in no small part to a long history of the United States supporting dictators in the region, and this is part of why so many of the people there look to Cuba as a source of hope and pride – it is the one nation that stood up to Uncle Sam and won out. There is one area of achievement which even Cuba’s critics have not been able to dismiss: healthcare. While you will often hear people grudgingly admit that Cuba ‘has good healthcare’, the scale of their programme and how many other countries they support is rarely properly appreciated, so it’s worth looking at them here in length. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eliminate the mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. More recently, even Richard Branson felt compelled to pen an article about Cuba’s extraordinary medical achievements and how the idiotic embargo prevents ordinary Americans from benefiting from Cuba’s medical innovations.11 Cuba currently has more healthcare workers in foreign countries than all G8 countries combined.12 In 2014, Cuba had 50,000 healthcare workers in sixty-five countries; that is more than the Red Cross, Médecins sans Frontières and UNICEF combined. Since 1960, over 101,000 Cuban health workers have provided care in 110 countries. There is even a history of Cuban medical outreach to countries openly hostile to Cuba, such as Nicaragua during the Somoza dictatorship, and even the USA.

In addition, Cuba has offered free – that is, the cost is borne by the Cuban people – medical scholarships to thousands of students from across the world on the condition that they return and serve the poor in their own countries. As of 2014, over 23,000 students from eighty-three countries had graduated from the ELAM campus (Cuba’s international medical school) since 2005.

So if the average Cuban is several times less likely to be murdered than the average South African – either by another Cuban or by the state – has access to healthcare, housing and education to a far greater degree and can expect to live more than ten years longer, it would be quite fair to say post-Castro Cuba is faring better than post-Mandela South Africa on many important human indices.

Anyway, I argued back that no matter what their opinions were on racial evolution – or other flaws for that matter – the NOI had no history of lynching white people, of collecting their body parts as souvenirs, of bombing white churches and of killing children and pregnant women. What’s more, the NOI did much good, like cleaning up drug addicts and policing some of America’s worst black ghettoes, helping to stop crime (the NOI had indeed sent some its members, unarmed, to challenge the drug dealers in some of the toughest US inner cities).

We may want to remember that after returning from his first trip to Africa, Richard Pryor announced that he would never call another black man a nigger again so long as he lived. Travelling around the continent, he marvelled at the fact that there were ‘no niggers there’ and added that in his time there, ‘I have not said it [the word], I have not even thought it.’ While uttered in the guise of comedy, this might be one of the most profound reflections on the black condition ever offered. Pryor understood instantly that the metaphysical category of the nigger could not possibly have the same meaning in Africa as it did in America.

While the physical legacies of white supremacy in Africa are clear enough, from the skin bleaching to the colonial borders to the languages of government, or from the segregation that is still so apparent in the former settler colonies, the state of spiritual and cultural crisis that Pryor denotes with the appellation ‘nigger’ simply does not seem to exist in the same way for Africans. Perhaps it’s just diaspora romanticism, but I felt that same feeling when I first set foot on the continent. It’s a quality that cannot be explained unless you have experienced both states. People who have experienced niggerisation or lifelong racism often walk as if they are apologising for their existence; it was only when I saw black people that did not walk that way that this became clear to me.

On the surface of things, a direct comparison between the ‘black experience’ in Britain and America may seem totally superficial because the historical differences are so vast. Black Americans were enslaved in America, in the land where they now reside, so when slavery was reformed – not abolished – in 1865 they were subject to a whole century of overt and essentially state-approved violent and legislative terrorism, both after and during the brief period known as the Reconstruction. This terror reached its apex in the 4000-plus spectacle lynchings that occurred in the early part of the last century, exhibiting some of most fantastical savagery in the annals of history which were often watched by thousands of white people, including children, in a picnic-like atmosphere. Eggs and lemonade were consumed, commemorative postcards were created and the body parts of black people that had been roasted alive, castrated and carved into pieces were kept as souvenirs.11 Clearly, nothing like this kind of white-supremacist terrorism has occurred in twentieth-century domestic Britain. There was also no formal segregation in the UK, by which I mean there were no laws officially preventing black people from voting, from renting houses where they chose to and from enrolling in whatever state-funded schools they lived within the catchment area of, though some MPs did openly call for a colour bar. British Caribbeans came to the UK voluntarily, on their own purse and as British citizens exercising the rights inherent in that citizenship. Post-war Britain adopted the principles of social democracy, meaning that the death penalty was abolished by 1947 and that all British citizens, regardless of colour, had access to higher education, healthcare and a degree of social security. This means that the state cannot racialise these institutions – the death penalty, healthcare and education – in the same way and to the same degree as the United States, thus eliminating some of the material basis for the most extreme racism. Black Brits emigrated into a society with an already established white underclass and were mostly dumped in areas where that underclass already lived; black Americans and the indigenous peoples were the foundation of the US underclass.

As former Prime Minister Tony Blair put it:   What we are dealing with is not a general social disorder, but specific groups or people who for one reason or another, are deciding not to abide by the same code of conduct as the rest of us . . . The black community – the vast majority of whom in these communities are decent, law-abiding people horrified at what is happening – need to be mobilised in denunciation of this gang culture that is killing innocent young black kids. But we won’t stop this by pretending it isn’t young black kids doing it.   I’m unsure who these people Mr Blair was referring to are, those that apparently pretend black people don’t ever kill, but I am yet to come across them. No one is more familiar with black people’s capacity to kill than other black people if by virtue of nothing else but proximity. This narrative of a uniquely black criminality became so strong in the London of my youth that a special police department was set up to tackle black-on-black violence! A person could take a totally superficial look at America without reference to history, see the horrendous violence in Chicago, and start a simplistic narrative about ‘black-on-black crime’, but the fact that this narrative has become so deeply embedded in British media, policing and political discourse just looks unbelievably bizarre when viewed nationally. When I was growing up, part of Britain was a war zone. Until the 1998 Good Friday agreement brought an ‘end’ to what is known as ‘The Troubles’, thousands of people had been killed in Northern Ireland as a result of the conflicts there. Even during the 1990s, the Troubles included multiple shootings and bombings that killed scores of people, including the 1998 bombing by the UVF that killed the three Quinn brothers aged nine, ten and eleven. If you asked someone why Northern Ireland – or indeed Glasgow – was so violent they would almost certainly give you a history lesson in both cases, one about the British Empire and its legacies in Ireland in one case, and the resultant conflicts between Catholics and Protestants there, and the other an interlinked story about the legacies of class neglect and deprivation in what was one of the poorest parts of Western Europe, the ‘housing schemes’13 of Glasgow. Neither of these explanations would be ‘making excuses’ for the violence of either region or the peoples there, but simply be trying to give some context for one of the most complex human phenomena; murder. Given that the historically most violent regions of the UK had virtually no black population at all and given that working-class youth gangs stabbing and shooting people had existed in Britain for well over a century – who do you think the gangs attacking our grandparents when they arrived were? – you can imagine my shock when I discovered that there was, in the UK, such a thing as ‘black-on-black’ violence. None of what occurred in Northern Ireland had ever been referred to as ‘white-on-white’ crime, nor Glasgow, nor either world war, the Seven Years War, the Napoleonic Wars, nor any conflict or incident of murder, however gruesome, between humans racialised as white. Despite hundreds of millions of ‘white’ people killing each other throughout European history, witch hunts, mass rapes, hangings, torture and sexual abuse, and despite the fact that the two most violent regions of Britain in the 1990s were almost entirely white, there was no such thing as white-on-white violence.

A similar but much larger controversy occurred when the character Rue in the film The Hunger Games was played by a black girl, Amandla Stenberg. Even though Rue is described as having brown skin in the original novel, ‘fans’ of the book were shocked and dismayed that the movie version cast a brown girl to play the role, and a Twitter storm of abuse about the ethnic casting of the role ensued. You have to read the responses to truly appreciate how angry and abusive they are.11 As blogger Dodai Stewart pointed out at the time:   All these . . . people . . . read The Hunger Games. Clearly, they all fell in love with and cared about Rue. Though what they really fell in love with was an image of Rue that they’d created in their minds. A girl that they knew they could love and adore and mourn at the thought of knowing that she’s been brutally killed. And then the casting is revealed (or they go see the movie) and they’re shocked to see that Rue is black. Now . . . this is so much more than, ‘Oh, she’s bigger than I thought.’ The reactions are all based on feelings of disgust. These people are MAD that the girl that they cried over while reading the book was ‘some black girl’ all along. So now they’re angry. Wasted tears, wasted emotions. It’s sad to think that had they known that she was black all along, there would have been [no] sorrow or sadness over her death.

In closing, it is worth asking what the formative race and class experiences of a child born in 2018 into a similar family to mine might be. If current trends continue, for the most part the answers don’t look very positive. They will be even more likely to go to prison than I was, as Britain’s incarceration state has expanded greatly during the course of my lifetime. They will probably be far less likely to receive adequate healthcare, as the NHS continues to shrink and/or be privatised. The banana skins will almost certainly not return and the small black middle class is probably now permanent, but the 2018 child will likely have far less chance of ‘lifting themselves out of poverty’ than I did, as the mechanisms that helped make that possible for me continue to be deliberately eroded.

Non-profits inherit their soft-control function from the social welfare state. In Regulating the Poor, Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward argue that social welfare programs in the United States mitigate tensions produced under capitalism by filling in for lack of access to full employment and supplementing inadequate wages and benefits. Piven and Cloward chart how social programs expand in the United States during periods of unrest in order to pacify the population and undermine the revolutionary potential of shared experiences of oppression in capitalism.10 The INCITE! volumes helped show the ways the US non-profit system may perform that role today, doing the work of the state and keeping in place the status quos of state-sponsored and supported forms of inequality and disenfranchisement. This work also takes the perhaps more insidious form of producing and managing forms of sexual and racial difference that meet the terms and needs of capitalism and the state. With their funding restrictions and a social service model of targeted constituents, non-profits may reproduce categories of deserving and undeserving along lines of legible and illegible identities in the communities on whose behalf the state calls on them to speak.

While continuing to be a vital formation for scholars and activists, the prison industrial complex critique has sometimes been mistakenly taken up as implicating only private prisons — those run directly by corporations under contracts from states — rather than the system of capitalism as a whole. Ruth Wilson Gilmore has argued that even thinking in terms of profit motive is not enough. Rather, in her study of the California prison system, Gilmore shows how what she terms the “prison fix” takes care of four surplus crises for neoliberal capital: surpluses of government capacity, land, finance, and labor. The last point is key, as Gilmore demonstrates how prisons serve to take out of circulation unemployed low-wage workers for whom enough of a reserve already exists.

In the terms of our above discussion, this is the direct control that accompanies the soft control of non-profit and education systems during the dismantling of the social safety net. By turning attention to these crises of surplus, Gilmore shows that prison expansion does not only offer a site for profit-making, but secures the US economy within globalization, putting the surpluses of government capacity, land, and finance to work while making redundant the racialized populations no longer needed in labor markets. In this way, prisons represent not just another industrial complex but a container for capitalism itself.16

During the late 1960s, radical movements for social change were transforming the shape of the United States while Third World liberation movements were challenging Western imperialism. Foundations began to take a role in shaping this organizing so that social protest would not challenge the capitalist status quo. Robert L. Allen, as early as 1969, warned of the co-optation of the Black Power movement by foundations. In his germinal work, Black Awakening in Capitalist America, reprinted in part in this anthology, Allen documents how the Ford Foundation’s support of certain Black civil rights and Black Power organizations such as CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) actually helped shift the movement’s emphasis—through the recruitment of key movement leaders—from liberation to Black capitalism. Similarly, Madonna Thunder Hawk describes how the offer of well-paying jobs in the non-profit sector seduced many Native activists into diverting their energy from organizing to social service delivery and program development. As Joan Roefels notes in Foundations and Public Policy (2003), large private foundations tended to fund racial justice organizations that focused on policy and legal reform, a strategy that effectively redirected activist efforts from radical change to social reform.

It also helped to professionalize these movements, since only those with advanced degrees could do this kind of work, thus minimizing the importance of mass-based grassroots organizing.

Another strategy developed to sublimate revolutionary movements into reformist ones was “leadership training” both domestically and internationally, whereby potential organizers were recruited to develop the skills to become policymakers and bureaucrats instead of organizers.21 As the essay on the NGOization of the Palestinian liberation movement in this volume shows, this strategy of “leadership development” is still being used to transform liberation struggles.

The impact of the NPIC on the antiviolence movement has been particularly disastrous because most of the government funding it receives has been through the Department of Justice, especially with the advent of the Violence Against Women Act. As a result, antiviolence organizations have focused primarily on criminal justice solutions to ending violence that reinforce the prison industrial complex; in fact, many antiviolence organizations are now located within police departments. Women of color, who must address both gender violence within their communities and state violence against their communities, have been particularly impacted by the direction the mainstream antiviolence movement has taken.

Women of color, who must address both gender violence within their communities and state violence against their communities, have been particularly impacted by the direction the mainstream antiviolence movement has taken. This NGOization of the antiviolence movement is also actively exported to other countries, following a model Gayatri Spivak calls “saving brown women from brown men”25 which tends to pathologize communities in the Third World for their “backward” attitudes toward women. The goal becomes to “save” Third World women from the extreme patriarchy in their community without looking at how patriarchy is connected to white supremacy and colonialism. Thus, for instance, mainstream feminist groups will support the bombing in Afghanistan to save Afghan women from the Taliban as if US empire actually liberates women. (In addition to the essays in this volume, further analysis of the co-optation of the antiviolence movement can be found in INCITE!’s previous book, Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology [2006]).

Women of color have also been particularly impacted by the role of foundations in the women’s health and reproductive justice movements. Foundations have been active in supporting the population control movement, which blames the reproductive capabilities of women of color and Third World women for almost all social ills, including poverty, war, and environmental destruction. For instance, John D. Rockefeller III founded the Population Council in 1952 to foster international population control policies under the notion that overpopulation causes unrest, and hence, revolution.26 The Population Council supported mass population control efforts in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s.27 And in the last six months of 1976, the Population Council supported the sterilization of 6.5 million people in India through the use of police raids to round up men and women, with thousands dying from infections caused by the unsanitary conditions under which the sterilizations were performed. In one village alone, all the young men were sterilized.28

Globally, both foundations and non-profits/NGOs have received widespread criticism for their implicit or explicit support of First World interests and free-market capitalism. Numerous foundations and non-profits have directly colluded with the Central Intelligence Agency. For instance, foundations have supported and continue to support CIA programs in educational exchanges with east Africa and Eastern Europe to maintain a US presence in these areas without the consent of Congress.41 The CIA also employs political scientists and collaborates with professors in sponsoring university institutes. These institutes were created on the advice of foundations that assumed scholars would be more likely to cooperate with intelligence work if it were done in an academic location. These scholars also helped recruit potential allies among foreign students.42 Additionally, the CIA directed funding through foundations to support cultural arts to recruit leftist cultural workers, and showcase US cultural achievements globally. Since the State Department could not fund such activities directly, they had to be funneled through foundations.43 Gerald Colby and Charlotte Dennett’s book Thy Will Be Done also charges that John D. Rockefeller III funded missionary agencies that collaborated with the CIA for several decades in Latin America. These missionaries/agents would befriend indigenous peoples in Latin America, collaborate with them to translate the Bible into indigenous languages, and then use these intermediaries to funnel intelligence information to the CIA to facilitate resource extraction and destabilize leftist regimes.44 Critics further charge that the Ford Foundation funded programs to revitalize Indian religions in India to counter the spread of communism. This tactic has the impact of defusing opposition from a leftist framework, but also fuels religious fundamentalism and the rise of Hindu Right nationalism.45

squelching revolutionary movements in the Third World. The Ford Foundation was actively involved through its various programs in diverting the antiapartheid movement in South Africa from an anticapitalist to a pro-capitalist movement.46 Cyril Ramaphosa, a secretary-general of the African National Congress who led a 1987 miners strike praised by the Ford Foundation,47 signed a $900 million contract with Anglo American, a corporation that accounts for 25 percent of South Africa’s gross domestic product and controls much of South Africa’s gold and diamond mining. The goal of this collaboration is to bring “blacks into the mainstream economy” rather than to challenge the economic status quo.48 As demonstrated in “The NGOization of the Palestine Liberation Movement,” a series of interviews with four longtime activists, these same strategies are being used by NGOs to deradicalize the struggle in Palestine.

Perhaps it is the fear of a radically transformed, feminist/queer/antiracist liberation of Black, Brown, and Red bodies, no longer presumed to be permanently subordinated to structures of criminalization, colonization, (state and state-ordained) bodily violence, and domestic warfare, that logically threatens the very existence of the still white-dominant US Left: perhaps it is, in part, the Left’s fear of an unleashed bodily proximity to currently criminalized, colonized, and normatively violated peoples that compels it to retain the staunchly anti-abolitionist political limits of the NPIC.

Civil institutions that once housed what Aldon Morris calls the “indigenous centers” of social movement and resistance organizing (e.g., schools, churches, families, friendship networks)17 are now far more likely to exhibit the penetration of the state through a popular epistemology that considers the violent policing of order to be a necessary condition of social life generally.

As this anthology attempts a critical and material intervention on the political stasis generated by the non-profit industrial complex, we can and should recall the recent history of socially disenfranchised and oppressed Black and Third World peoples whose demands for liberation and radical freedom (which I am distinguishing from the white bourgeois freedom that is hegemonic in the United States) have represented, for white civil society, the specter of its own undoing. I want to emphasize the importance of this contemporary liberationist lineage because I have observed a peculiar dynamic in the current political landscape that makes political fodder of this liberationist legacy. With increasing frequency, we are party (or participant) to a white liberal and “multicultural”/“people of color” liberal imagination that venerates and even fetishizes the iconography and rhetoric of contemporary Black and Third World liberation movements, and then proceeds to incorporate these images and vernaculars into the public presentation of foundation-funded liberal or progressive organizations. I have also observed and experienced how these organizations, in order to protect their nonprofit status and marketability to liberal foundations, actively self-police against members’ deviations from their essentially reformist agendas, while continuing to appropriate the language and imagery of historical revolutionaries. Having lived in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1995 to 2001, which is in many ways the national hub of the progressive “wing” of the NPIC, I would name some of those organizations (many of which are defunct) here, but the list would be too long. Suffice it to say that these non-profit groups often exhibit(ed) a political practice that is, to appropriate and corrupt a phrase from fellow contributor Ruth Wilson Gilmore, radical in form, but liberal in content.19

Antistate state actors welcomed non-profits under the rhetoric of efficiency (read: meager budgets) and accountability (read: contracts could be pulled if anybody stepped out of line). As a result of these and other pressures, non-profits providing direct services have become highly professionalized by their relationship with the state. They have had to conform to public rules governing public money, and have found that being fiduciary agents in some ways trumps their principal desire to comfort and assist those abandoned to their care. They do not want to lose the contracts to provide services because they truly care about clients who otherwise would have nowhere to go; thus they have been sucked into the world of non-profit providers, which, like all worlds, has its own jargon, limits (determined by bid and budget cycles, and legislative trends), and both formal as well as informal hierarchies. And, generally, the issues they are paid to address have been narrowed to program-specific categories and remedies which make staff—who often have a great understanding of the scale and scope of both individual clients’ and the needs of society at large—become in their everyday practice technocrats through imposed specialization.10 The shadow state, then, is real but without significant political clout, forbidden by law to advocate for systemic change, and bound by public rules and non-profit charters to stick to its mission or get out of business and suffer legal consequences if it strays along the way.

Another part of the program, designated as a “youth leadership training program,” began in November. In all, some 62 youths, ranging in age from seventeen to twenty-one, were involved in this project. The project was designed, according to the CORE report, to “identify and train urban ghetto youth in those […] skills which can serve as an alternative to frustration and violence…” To this end the youngsters attended classes on black history, African history, and social science. They were taught skills in canvassing, interviewing, and recording community opinions. There was apparently little discussion of who would ever read (not to mention act upon) their interviews and reports of community sentiment. Some of the [project] staff…were taken on visits to black-owned businesses in Chicago. In short, youths who had no faith in the “system” were taught that if only they could resocialize themselves, they might fit in after all. The director of the youth training program, Philip Carter, said his project hoped to show that “the legitimate hostilities and aggressions of black youth” could be “programmed” into socially acceptable channels. He expressed the hope that the youths being trained would become “young black urban renewal specialists, young black sociologists, and young black political scientists.” He did not say—and did not need to say—in whose interest these young black experts would be put to work. The mere fact that there aren’t any genuinely black-controlled educational institutions guarantees that if they are to work, they must work in the interest of continued white domination of every facet of black life. Militant rhetoric was used to cover up the cooptative nature of this project. “Our job as an organization,” said Arthur Evans, a member of Cleveland CORE and national first vice chairman of the organization, “is to prepare people to make a decision on revolution or not. The choice is whether to take land and resources and redistribute them.” The evidence of the [Cleveland project] suggests that CORE decided against revolution.

These paragraphs suggest certain economic changes, but they leave unanswered the critical question of in whose interest is economic power to be exercised? Simple transference of business ownership into black hands, either individually or collectively, is in itself no guarantee that this will benefit the total community. Blacks are capable of exploiting one another just as easily as whites. It was this ambiguity, however, that opened the way for CORE to move toward black capitalism. What had begun as a Harlem CORE project was now shaping up as the over-all strategy of national CORE. Black power was slowly but relentlessly coming to be equated with the power of black business.

But this reasoning is based on the inherent falsehood that scarcity—rather than inequality—is at the root of these persisting social and economic problems.6 This worldview nurtures a culture of noblesse oblige, the belief that the wealthy and privileged are obliged to help those less fortunate, without examining how that wealth was created or the dangerous implications of conceding such power to the wealthy.

Not only have the bulk of foundations’ funds gone to establishment institutions, including their very own trustees—the actual dollars that have gone to social change work, particularly in relation to overall investments and funds, can be characterized as stingy. Another controversial side of philanthropy is the tax policy that governs foundation “payout,” the term used to describe the annual qualifying distribution of financial assets. Although foundations must pay out 5 percent of their assets annually, this does not mean they give out 5 percent of their assets as grants. This 5 percent includes administrative expenses such as rent and salaries, program-related investments, amounts set aside for future charitable projects, and trustee fees. The payout rate was actually reduced to 5 percent in 1981 by Congress. As a result, the ratio of grant payouts to assets dropped from 8 percent in 1981 to 6 percent by the end of the 1980s and to below 5 percent in 1997. Given current enormous public needs, courageous leaders from progressive foundations and non-profits have demanded an increase in the private foundation payout rate to at least 6 percent, excluding administrative and operating expenses. Yet the majority of foundations have insisted that they cannot afford to pay out more if they hope to conserve their resources for the future, particularly with the emergence of new and unforeseeable social problems due to uncertainty in financial markets.14

the Rockefeller Foundation, and later the Ford Foundation, bankrolled the massive global restructuring of agriculture known as the Green Revolution. The ostensible goal was to end world hunger by transferring Western scientific agricultural techniques to less-developed countries to increase crop yields. In just 50 years, the Green Revolution increased food production substantially, but it also permanently transformed agriculture and destroyed the livelihoods of millions of farmers and villages that had been in existence for hundreds of years.

Through the Gates Foundation—which has more assets than any other foundation in the world—the chairman of the world’s largest corporation36 spends almost $6 billion each year vaccinating Africans from disease.37 It is estimated that through his philanthropy, the Gates Foundation has saved more than 100,000 lives. But let’s think about this for a minute. What do vaccines (and the drug companies that manufacture them) have in common with Microsoft and its software and hardware products? One thing they share in common is that their patents are protected by the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules of the World Trade Organization.38 According to investigative reporter Greg Palast, “TRIPS gives Gates a hammerlock on computer operating systems worldwide, legally granting him the kind of monopoly the Robber Barons of yore could only dream of. But TRIPS, the rule which helps Gates rule, also bars African governments from buying AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis medicine at cheap market prices.”39 In other words, with his left hand, Bill Gates spends billions of dollars through the Gates Foundation to vaccinate the millions of Africans dying of AIDS. Meanwhile, with his right hand, “his Foundation has invested $200 million in the very drug companies stopping the shipment of low-cost AIDS drugs to Africa.”40

First, foundations can and should pay out more of their assets to charities. In 2003, a bipartisan bill in Congress introduced by Roy Blunt, Republican from Missouri, and Harold Ford, Jr., Democrat from Tennessee, would have required foundations to distribute 5 percent of their assets annually—all in grants. The legislation would have prohibited foundations from counting administrative costs like rent and staff salaries against the 5 percent. This amount is still highway robbery, and, as Pablo Eisenberg has so eloquently put it, “Foundations should accept a slight payout increase as a good deal. It’s a better deal than they deserve.” Unfortunately, the nation’s largest foundations mounted an extensive lobbying campaign to defeat this provision of the legislation. The hundreds of thousands of dollars that they spent on this “self-defense” lobbying could be counted—ironically—toward their 5 percent payout.

Over time, funding trends actually come to influence our work, priorities, and direction as we struggle to remain competitive and funded in the movement market. For many activists, this has shifted the focus from strategies for radical change to charts and tables that demonstrate how successfully the work has satisfied foundation-determined benchmarks. Ironically, it is also foundations that most often bring similar social justice groups together from all over the country. And we spend this rare, precious time together walking through the foundations’ agendas, meeting their priorities, and contributing to the publications, manuals, and essays they distribute on “the field of organizing.” Meanwhile, the occasions we do come together to discuss our own needs, based on our own agendas, and without the gaze of funders, are few and far between.

The criminalization of domestic violence created a dual advantage for the state: the perpetrator became the sole party responsible for violence against women while the state positioned itself against the perpetrator and thereby as an ally of battered women. Criminalization also buttressed the state’s claim that prisons were the solution to domestic violence, a framework that has been proven to the contrary while yielding disastrous results for women of color and their communities.14 Interestingly, this development closely parallels the growth of the prison industrial complex (PIC) and the heightened criminalization of domestic violence through mandatory arrest policies, development of new crime legislation, and steepening sentences for existing crimes.

One of the dangerous effects of the criminalization process is that it has inhibited grassroots organizing and creative community thinking about real solutions to domestic violence. Instead, the now-naturalized response to domestic violence is to “call the cops,” a tactic that doesn’t work too well for communities already under attack by the racism of law enforcement, immigration laws and enforcement, and the prison industrial complex. Additionally, mandatory arrest laws, which are pervasive throughout the country, require an arrest be made if there is a domestic violence call. But rather than protecting women against domestic violence, these policies often revictimize the survivor by either leading to her arrest (if she so much as scratched her abuser in self-defense) or to the arrest of the abuser without survivor consent. In 2004, INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence and Critical Resistance released a joint statement regarding the criminalization of domestic violence that revealed the state’s true colors: As an overall strategy for ending violence, criminalization has not worked. In fact, the overall impact of mandatory arrest laws for domestic violence has led to decreases in the number of battered women who kill their partners in self-defense, but they have not led to a decrease in the number of batterers who kill their partners. Thus, the law protects batterers more than it protects survivors.17

While the ruling class might not all sit down together in a room and decide policy, members of this class do go to school together, vacation together, live together, and share ideas through various newspapers and magazines, conferences, think tanks, spokespeople, and research and advocacy groups. They do meet in Congress, corporate offices, foundation boardrooms, elite law firms, and in national and international gatherings to make significant social, political, and economic decisions for their collective benefit. Perhaps most important, members of this class sit together on interlocking boards of directors of major corporations and wield great power on corporate decisions. Because multinational corporations have larger economies, greater security forces, and more political clout than most countries, those who sit on boards of corporate directors collectively wield tremendous influence on political decisions through lobbying, government appointments, corporate-funded research, interpersonal connections, and advisory appointments, as well as the power they wield through direct economic and political intervention in local communities and in the affairs of other countries.3 The next 19 percent of the economic pyramid, the professional/managerial class, consists of people who work for the ruling class. Members of this class may not gain the same level of power and financial rewards as people at the very top, but their work provides the research, managerial skills, expertise, technological development, and other resources which the ruling class needs to maintain and justify its monopolization of political and economic power. This class also carries out the direct management of the largest public, private, and non-profit enterprises in the country. But it is the majority of the population, the bottom 80 percent, which produces the social wealth benefiting those at the top. Laboring in factories, fields, classrooms, homes, sweatshops, prisons, hospitals, restaurants, and small businesses, the individuals composing this enormous class keep our society functioning and productive. Meanwhile, entire communities remain entrapped in endless cycles of competition, scarcity, violence, and insecurity that those at the top are largely protected from.

The non-profit industrial complex was not always so huge. During the civil rights period, when there were large-scale marches, sit-ins, protests, and demonstrations, policy makers at the largest foundations decided that they should fund some of the more moderate leadership in the Black community both to elicit their cooperation and to provide some measure of services that might lessen dissent. Money began to be funneled into “acceptable” (that is, non-radical) community groups as a way to forestall and co-opt further protest and to steer public policy towards the provision of individual services.7 Until that period, most activists and community members working for social change were not employed by nonprofits. Although some were paid for their work, most worked voluntarily in neighborhood associations, unions, church groups, and cultural and other civic organizations. During the 1970s, the NPIC increased dramatically as a response to the continued protests of antiwar, women’s liberation, queer liberation, and other social movements. Soon it became common for people to be paid to do “good work” by providing services for people in the community. Non-profit management became a career path and many subspecialties of non-profit programming were developed, such as youth work, violence prevention work, senior services, domestic violence services, housing services, and job training programs.

In 2000, non-profits controlled over $1.59 trillion in financial assets and had expenditures of over $822 billion.6 Non-profits also control significant amounts of federal and state monies through contracts for the provision of public services such as health care, education, housing, employment training, and jobs. The ruling class, through the non-profit sector, controls billions of dollars of private and government money ostensibly earmarked for the public good, but subject to virtually no public control.

In this group I include all of us whose intention is to “help” people at the bottom of the pyramid, but whose work, in practice, helps perpetuate their inability to change the circumstances which force them to need this assistance in the first place.

The problem is not with providing social services. Many radical groups, such as the Black Panthers and the Zapatistas, have provided social services as a tool for organizing. The problem comes when all our time and energy is diverted toward social services to the detriment of long-term social change. Clearly, there is a tremendous difference between helping people get ahead individually and mobilizing buffer-zone resources to help people get together, a difference activists working within the NPIC should be mindful of in thinking about whether we are empowering people to work for social change at the same time we are providing them with social services.

Let’s look at domestic violence work as an example. If we accept the dominant paradigm, which frames domestic violence as an interpersonal issue and the result of a breakdown in the normative heterosexual nuclear family, and views battered women as victims, that framework will lead us to try to protect the “victims” from further violence, provide them with services, and try to help them get ahead (and, even better, eventually into a healthy heterosexual nuclear family). We will treat them individually, as clients, and hold the people (primarily men) who beat them individually accountable for their violence through stronger criminal justice sanctions and batterer groups. We will try to help survivors escape battering relationships and to move forward in their lives. We will be advocates for more services, better services, culturally competent services, multilingual services, and we will advocate for strong and effective sanctions against men who are batterers. We will measure our success by how many battered women we served, and our success stories will be about how individual women were able to escape the violence of abusive families and get on with their lives. Our advocacy success stories will be about how various communities of women were provided better services and how batterers were either locked up or transformed. Rather than accept this social service (and racist, sexist, and heterosexist) framework, however, we could understand family violence (in both heterosexual and queer families) as a direct result of economic inequality, colonization, and other forms of state violence, and of patriarchal and heterosexual norms—and that, in particular, women who are battered are caught in cycles that are the result of systematic exploitation, disempowerment, and isolation. This analysis would further acknowledge the structural forces that keep women in battering relationships: community tolerance for male violence, lack of well-paying jobs, lack of decent childcare and affordable housing, and, most of all, their isolation from one another and from the information and resources they need to come together to effect change. As organizers and resource providers, we would provide organizational and structural support for battered women to organize on their own behalf. We would not be working for battered women; we would be working with them. “They” would be “us”—battered women would be in leadership in the movement to end violence against women, holding the jobs that currently many non-battered women do. We would measure success by the strength of our programs for leadership development and the community response to domestic violence. We would work for changes in the economic, educational, penal/law enforcement (including immigration law), military, and social service institutions which condone, encourage, or perpetuate violence against women and keep women trapped in abusive relationships. Our success stories would be about how battered women became leaders, educators, and organizers, and how communities of people came together to develop strategies and wield power.

Who supervises your work? I don’t mean who employs you or hires or funds you, although these are important considerations in a conservative political climate when jobs are scarce. Who are the grassroots activists who advise you and review your work? If you are a male antiviolence activist, it is particularly important that you be accountable to women who are doing different kinds of antisexist organizing. If you are white, it is critical for you to be accountable to people of color with a progressive antiracist agenda so that your work doesn’t inadvertently fuel the backlash to the gains of the civil rights movement or otherwise collude with attacks on people of color. If you are a person with economic privilege, you need to be listening to the voices of poor and working-class people struggling for economic justice. Of course, these are not isolated identities. We can and should be accountable to groups and organizations which have a multi-issue social justice perspective. Regardless of your ethnicity, race, gender, or economic position, as an activist (particularly, as one who has gained access to the buffer zone) you need to be accountable to people who are on the front lines of movements for social justice. You have to be engaged in a critical dialogue, while recognizing that because of your race, gender, class, sexual orientation, educational level, or other form of privilege you most likely have been socialized by our culture to expect to have all the answers and not to listen to those who have less social and political power than you do (that is, internalized supremacy). Therefore, I think it is important that privileged activists participate directly in some form of grassroots struggle, making sure to consult thoroughly and extensively with other activists similarly engaged.

I was no less prejudiced than other reporters of the strike. I've always claimed simply that my prejudices are equally strong but different from the mainstream. This assertion of mine has led some critics to describe this book as "an admittedly biased account." True enough, but I know when I'm being patted on the head. The implication is that the alternative to an "admittedly biased" book is a real-live honest, accurate one. I contend, on the contrary, that among books written by humans the only alternative is a "secretly biased" one. Both sorts of accounts can be more or less accurate, but where honesty is concerned, an unacknowledged bias hits a lot farther off the mark than an acknowledged one. The latter is less insidious, and probably more useful to the reader.

Scenes from South Africa that shock the international conscience—destitute, dusty shanty towns where Black children grow up in the shadow of a privileged life they cannot touch—are not so different from what Arizona mining towns looked like when Harry Truman was president or, for that matter, John Kennedy. As late as the 1960s, segregation here was absolute. It extending to housing, schools, movie theaters, and social clubs. The first interracial couple in Morenci—a white woman who married a Mexican man— couldn't rent a house for decades. As one woman who grew up here put it, "There was a separate everything." In Ajo, Mexican-Americans were allowed to swim in the public pool once a week, on Wednesdays, just before the water was changed.

It was close to the turn of the century when Arizona miners began their slow, steady effort to organize. Phelps Dodge has held dominion among the state's copper companies since 1900, and the corporation's history has been marked by some well-known clashes with its employees. The most notorious of these boiled over just as the U.S. economy was mobilizing for World War I. Thanks to the booming demand for communications cable and shell jackets, Phelps Dodge enjoyed more than a 200 percent increase in net profits over the previous year. The comparative meagerness of their wages rankled the miners, and their unions gained broad support. But in 1917 their broadside collided with superior force: in the quiet of an early July morning, a posse of sheriff's deputies and vigilantes rode into the streets of Bisbee, arrested some two thousand striking miners and sympathizers, forced them into waiting boxcars of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad (a Phelps Dodge subsidiary), and hauled them over 173 miles of desert to a detention camp in central New Mexico, from which few ever returned to Bisbee.

The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination was first recognized by the League of Nations in 1919. Palestine, which had been part of the Ottoman Empire until its collapse at the end of WWI, was among a number of non-self-governing Arab territories in the Middle East that were placed under temporary “tutelage,” or administration of foreign powers under the League of Nations mandate system, until the peoples of these territories were deemed “ready” for independence. In 1922, the League of Nations entrusted the Mandate for Palestine (considered to be “Class A” or closest to independence) to Great Britain. Contrary to the intent and purpose of the mandate system (that is, to administer Palestine and its peoples through to independence), Great Britain also recognized the demand of the Zionist movement to establish an exclusive Jewish state in Palestine. Under the terms of the 1922 Mandate for Palestine as drafted by the British government (which incorporated the 1917 Balfour Declaration whereby the British government first recognized Zionist demands for an exclusive Jewish state), the British administration in Palestine was required to “secure the establishment of the Jewish national home” in Palestine through Jewish immigration and settlement. As for the majority of the inhabitants of the country (that is, Palestinian Arabs), who were referred to as the “non-Jewish communities,” the 1922 mandate only recognized their civil and religious rights; their political rights, including the right to self-determination, were ignored.

The violation of the human rights of Palestinians inside Israel, the 1967 occupied territories, as well as in Arab states such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Kuwait has led to further cycles of displacement. While there are no exact figures to illustrate the impact of these policies, it is estimated that over three decades of Israeli policies of land confiscation, house demolition, revocation of residency rights, and deportation have led to the forced displacement of several thousand Palestinians. The 1970 conflict between the government of Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the civil war and Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the 1980s, the 1991 Gulf War, and the violation of basic human rights of Palestinian refugees residing in these areas—including the massacre of several thousand Palestinian refugees in the camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut by Lebanese Christian Phalangists allied with Israel—has led to further displacement, with many Palestinians having experienced multiple displacements in their lifetime.

Between September 16 and 18, 1982, several thousand Palestinian refugees—men, women, and children—were brutally slaughtered by Lebanese Christian Phalangist forces allied with Israel, while Israeli forces looked on and prevented refugees from fleeing the camps. The massacre happened within weeks of the US-brokered withdrawal of PLO fighters from Lebanon in the late summer of 1982. Left without protection, Israeli-allied Lebanese forces were able to enter the camps of West Beirut without opposition. On September 16, the day the massacre began, General Amos Yaron, commander of Israeli forces in Lebanon—and later director general of the Israeli Defense Ministry—provided Lebanese Forces Intelligence with aerial photographs to facilitate entry into the camps.4

Three home demolitions and one pending order For the al-Atrash family in Hebron, Occupied Palestine The first time the bulldozers came I was at school Challenged with negative numbers Who thought zero had an inferior? I ate a hard-boiled egg for breakfast And drank mint tea sugared By Mama’s sweet fingers In break, Lena and I clapped our hands And sang “Sister, sister, where is Mama? Mama’s in the city. What’s she doing? Kneading dough. Where is Baba?” The second time they came I stood in the doorway Israeli bulldozers needed to crush me If they wanted to trample my home Again But the soldiers didn’t care that I was Fifteen and female Long hair just made it easier to pull me Away They spit on Mama but she wouldn’t move, Not her baby’s home she screamed She looked so strong, I swear I thought her fingers would shoot lightning It took three soldiers to take her down Expose her breasts to the watchful sky Spill her hair from her God-fearing hijab And push her into the wailing dirt Baba choked on his own screams I think breathing got too hard for him Because he stopped crying and The Israeli soldier clenched his curly head To keep him watching the stones Of his 15-hour work days selling hot sesame seed bread Crumble After a while Baba couldn’t taste his bloody mouth Couldn’t see His littered teeth through His purple swollen eyes I bet he even forgot about the rifle’s eyes Glaring into his neck. My brother Hasan jumped Without thinking Ran for his books It was his final year 3 more weeks he would take his matriculation exams and Graduate to university He was going to be an engineer Going to build bridges To connect Palestine’s torn back But one Israeli soldier kicked his Hands with a Sharp black boot So hard His books flew into suffocating mud Sealed their pages silent Those aren’t cheap Cost Baba 40 hours work just to buy 2 books The mud ate 6 and Hasan watched his bridge collapse Now he drives a taxi 17 hours in our 24-hour days The third time they came I lay in my husband’s bed Staring at the ceiling Mama, Baba and Hasan did not, could not know Because the bulldozers always came back Before we could finish rebuilding our home I lay in my husband’s bed awake I couldn’t sleep Stopped sleeping with marriage Because I knew Mama, Baba and Hasan couldn’t fall asleep In half-built homes without roofs But Mama and Baba wanted One of their babies to know The inside of an undemolished home The next time they come I’ll be strapped with a ticking vest Missiles loaded on my shoulders and Land mines beneath my feet A sling shot on my ears and Rocks on my belt Daring the Israeli soldier to Take one more Step.

In 1997 and 1998, I started to observe from my work in these human rights NGOs that they are a bit isolated, and while they claim to defend people’s human rights, they are not invested in the question of social change and social justice. For instance, if we look at the case of workers who are fired or on strike—a labor organizer would work with them to continue their activism and organization. But the NGO legal aid staffer would ask to be authorized legally to sue the employer on the worker’s behalf. In other words, the NGO asks the worker to stop her/his activism: “Go home and just authorize me to sue him.” After 1998, I continued to work in these NGOs with no big hope that they will really do genuine human rights work. I started to work voluntarily with labor as well as the Palestine solidarity movement, and it became clear that my work for human rights NGOs was just a paid job.

In South Africa, foundations were instrumental in directing the antiapartheid struggle away from an anticapitalist framework. Has any similar process happened in Palestine? Hatem Bazian: Yes. Eighty percent of the infrastructure in Palestine is funded by international granting agencies. These agencies stifle critiques of capitalism and try to normalize the free market economy in the occupied territories. They train elites within Palestine to integrate into the global economy. Now, maquiladoras are being constructed in the Gaza Strip, with the elites in Palestine negotiating with Israel to develop these economic units. The result is the development of an economic elite that will become invested in the well-being of Israel. All such efforts are funded by granting agencies which require that these economic development programs be connected to Israel structurally. Similar strategies to tie economic elites to Israel are being used in Egypt and Jordan, primarily through the development of free trade zones. In Jordan, Israel is developing joint venture companies with Jordan elites that rely on cheap labor from Jordan and Palestine. Establishing these zones in Jordan essentially ensures that Jordanians will not try to cross into Israel, while encouraging Palestinians to migrate to Jordan so they will be less inclined to press for their right to return. Egypt has also signed an economic agreement with Israel to expand markets with Israeli investment. Again, NGOs are supporting the integration of Palestine into the capitalist global economy so that it will be dependent on Israel.

Liberation theology has also been critical to one of Brasil’s largest current social movements: the Landless Workers Movement (MST, or Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra). In the late 1970s, the MST gained momentum during the height of Brasil’s military dictatorship and during a period that became known as the “Brasilian Miracle.” While the modernization of the nation reached new heights, rural farm workers and sharecroppers increasingly found themselves displaced by the mechanization of agriculture.7 This led to increased protests and many deaths amongst rural communities across Brasil. In 1979, the MST was formed by landless farmworkers who occupied a piece of land in the Encruzilhada Natalino (in the state of Rio Grande do Sul) with the support of church organizations also based in the liberation theology movement. During the 1980s and 90s the MST grew tremendously and continues today in advancing a radical, participatory, socialist vision for land reform in Brasil. Today more than 300,000 families have won land titles to over 15 million acres after MST land takeovers. MST communities have spread throughout the country and can be found in 23 of Brasil’s 27 states.8 What is most powerful about this movement is that it has gone beyond the question of land to address the more fundamental question of how to structure the societies that are being created within the settlements and encampments in a manner that reflects their vision of justice. This means that much of their work is about restructuring social relations, including how decisions are made, as they create their own model for schools, community safety, gender equity, economic cooperatives, and other essential frameworks for everyday life.

While direct confrontations with state power are ongoing and necessary, these are actually just one small part of the struggle. As Zibechi observes: “To understand this involves reversing one’s perspective: rejecting the negative and state-centered viewpoint—which defines people by what they lack (needy, excluded, marginalized)—and adopting another way of looking which starts with the differences that they have created in order then to visualize other possible paths.”

As Zibechi observes: “To understand this involves reversing one’s perspective: rejecting the negative and state-centered viewpoint—which defines people by what they lack (needy, excluded, marginalized)—and adopting another way of looking which starts with the differences that they have created in order then to visualize other possible paths.”7 For example, when US activists think about the Zapatista movement, the first image that frequently comes to mind is the popular Left postcard of Zapatista indigenous women fighting with the Mexican military. One of the women is choking a soldier. However, this kind of confrontation, though important, is really a small part of the work being done to build this movement. For over 20 years, the Zapatistas have organized almost 100,000 people to create their own separate communities, their own justice system, their own health care system, their own agriculture, and their own educational system. The day-to-day groundwork of these projects is not the sexy thing that gets the attention of the public like the dramatic confrontation of an unarmed woman with soldiers. But the Zapatistas’ global contributions run far deeper. Casanova addresses this directly: : Among the rich contributions of the Zapatista movement toward building an alternative is the recent project of the “caracoles” (conches). The project of the “caracoles,” according to Comandante Javier, “opens up new possibilities of resistance and autonomy for the indigenous people of Mexico and the world—a resistance which includes all those social sectors that struggle for democracy, for liberty and justice for all.” It invites us to build towards community and autonomy with the patience and tranquility of the conch. The idea of creating organizations to be used as tools to achieve certain objectives and values, and to ensure that autonomy and the motto “mandar obedeciendo” (“lead by obeying”) do not remain in the sphere of abstract concepts and incoherent words.

While it is important to be critical of the non-profit system, we do not necessarily need to get rid of it all together. Revolutionary movements around the world use non-profits (NGOs) as well, but they have a different relationship with them. In the United States, many are attempting to do organizing work through non-profits. In other places, the movement building happens outside non-profits. However, these groups will sometimes start an NGO that serves a strategic purpose (such as providing technical assistance), but the non-profit does not have power to determine the movement’s direction. Rather it is accountable to the movement.

These reflections, lessons, and revolutionary guiding principles are particularly helpful for those of us who are organizing at the crossroads of oppression (on the basis of class, gender, race, sexuality, and so on). Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, there were many national revolutionary struggles that did achieve real change in their respective countries. However, these movements generally focused only on overthrowing capitalism and did not address the intersections of capitalism with patriarchy, racism, and other forms of oppression. Class was identified in the classic Marxist analysis as the “primary” contradiction. By the early 1970s, organizers began critiquing this model for marginalizing women, indigenous peoples, and other people from “ethnic minorities.” In addition, these older models conceptualized the struggle as happening only at the level of institutional change, either armed or traditional electoral political struggles. Struggle was not something one could participate in through one’s everyday life. Rather, true revolutionaries were supposed to leave their home, go to the mountains to be trained to join armed struggle, or work grueling political election campaigns for months away from home and family. This mode of organizing was based on a macho revolutionary standard of struggle in which commitment is measured by how “tough” you are, how much you can sacrifice family and love in order to focus on the revolutionary process. Mostly, this resulted in women being left behind to raise children on their own, many times not knowing if their partners had been murdered or if they had chosen new intimate relationships. Some women were also integrated into these struggles, but only if they “dressed like men,” acted in cold blood, left their children and families for years at a time, and followed the order of command and obey.

In these new movements, much of the political work happens close to home. It’s not that mass demonstrations are no longer considered useful. But there is a growing understanding that such tactics, once required on a regular basis to demonstrate your political commitment, are largely, if not entirely, alien to the reality of most people’s lives, especially poor people struggling just to survive.

In these new movements, much of the political work happens close to home. It’s not that mass demonstrations are no longer considered useful. But there is a growing understanding that such tactics, once required on a regular basis to demonstrate your political commitment, are largely, if not entirely, alien to the reality of most people’s lives, especially poor people struggling just to survive. When collectively reimagined by movement members, however, mass demonstrations can take on a new and differently gendered character. For the Zapatistas, as Javier Elorriaga, one of the EZLN’s main public figures explains, it’s necessary to build from below, to be constantly consulting; to be looking for new forms of participation, for those who have time [to] participate and those who don’t have time; the woman who has children and has, in addition, another job and comes home to feed them; even the mother who can’t attend the assemblies, that she, too, have the possibility to participate politically. And all of this on the margins of power.17 In other words: What if, as a tired, overworked, and underpaid or unpaid woman I do not have to add going to this march to my list of things to do? What if, instead, I could integrate my political participation into my daily life? What if there were a “space” where I could build and learn politically with others, a space I could go to that was part of how I take care of myself and others? Here again, the Zapatistas’ caracoles offer us another visionary model that extends beyond mere protest or demonstration to a long-term and integrative approach to resistance.

Today’s society is no longer Foucault’s disciplinary world of hospitals, madhouses, prisons, barracks, and factories. It has long been replaced by another regime, namely a society of fitness studios, office towers, banks, airports, shopping malls, and genetic laboratories. Twenty-first-century society is no longer a disciplinary society, but rather an achievement society [Leistungsgesellschaft]. Also, its inhabitants are no longer “obedience-subjects” but “achievement-subjects.” They are entrepreneurs of themselves. The walls of disciplinary institutions, which separate the normal from the abnormal, have come to seem archaic. Foucault’s analysis of power cannot account for the psychic and topological changes that occurred as disciplinary society transformed into achievement society. Nor does the commonly employed concept of “control society” do justice to this change. It still contains too much negativity.

People who suffer from depression, bipolar disorder, or burnout syndrome develop the symptoms displayed by the Muselmänner in concentration camps. Muselmänner are emaciated prisoners lacking all vigor who, like people with acute depression, have become entirely apathetic and can no longer even recognize physical cold or the orders given by guards. One cannot help but suspect that the late-modern animal laborans with neuronal disturbances would have been a Muselmann, too—albeit well fed and probably obese.

The job that the narrator has fits the definition of what anthropologist David Graeber calls a “bullshit job,” a concept he first defined in the magazine Strike! in 2013. The short piece went viral (and, in a turn befitting Fight Club’s “Operation Mayhem,” was even made into faux advertisements that were posted as guerilla art in the London Underground). What is a “bullshit job”? To cite Graeber’s answer, A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.113 The narrator never utters such a sentiment, never seems to consider the role or purpose of his job, but Graeber’s definition fits the film’s aforementioned and much-quoted line. Graeber’s definition matches the overall perspective of the film: what is alienating about contemporary work is not that it is physically exhausting, or even, as in Office Space, that it demands too much time and too much subjective commitment, but rather that it is pointless, having no real meaning and presenting no real challenge other than that of getting through the day.

Reports of the abuses of worthy victims not only pass through the filters; they may also become the basis of sustained propaganda campaigns. If the government or corporate community and the media feel that a story is useful as well as dramatic, they focus on it intensively and use it to enlighten the public. This was true, for example, of the shooting down by the Soviets of the Korean airliner KAL 007 in early September 1983, which permitted an extended campaign of denigration of an official enemy and greatly advanced Reagan administration arms plans. As Bernard Gwertzman noted complacently in the New York Times of August 31, 1984, U.S. officials “assert that worldwide criticism of the Soviet handling of the crisis has strengthened the United States in its relations with Moscow.” In sharp contrast, the shooting down by Israel of a Libyan civilian airliner in February 1973 led to no outcry in the West, no denunciations for “cold-blooded murder,”120 and no boycott. This difference in treatment was explained by the New York Times precisely on the grounds of utility: “No useful purpose is served by an acrimonious debate over the assignment of blame for the downing of a Libyan airliner in the Sinai peninsula last week.”121 There was a very “useful purpose” served by focusing on the Soviet act, and a massive propaganda campaign ensued.122

As Althusser writes, This ideology that “makes the workers go” comprises the following basic elements, which are so many illusions and impostures, yet “are successful” as long as the workers’ class struggle does not combat them: 1) the bourgeois legal illusion according to which “labor is paid for at its value”; 2) the corresponding legal-moral ideology which has it that one must “respect one’s labor contract” and, through it, the enterprise’s house rules and regulations; 3) the technicist-economist ideology which has it that “there must, after all, be different jobs within the division of labor” and such-and-such individuals to fill them. This ideology does a great deal more to make workers “go” than repression does.3

Frédéric Lordon, an economist and philosopher, makes the provocative statement that Spinoza should be understood as providing an answer to a question that Marx posed but could not answer: Why do workers continue to work for their own exploitation rather than revolution? Why do workers continue working for others every day?5 To say that this is a question Marxism does not answer is a bit misleading, for there are indeed answers to this question throughout Marx’s writing. The most immediate is to be found in the destruction of any alternative, any way of living outside of the market and labor, without which it is the worker’s “drive for self-preservation and propagation” that keeps the worker returning to the factory gate.6 As we saw in the previous chapter, the very institutions of wage labor give this natural drive an ideological veneer. Or, as Marx suggests in the next paragraph, survival is always mediated by social relations and their representations: The Roman slave was held by chains; the wage-labourer is bound to his owner by invisible threads. The appearance of independence is maintained by a constant change in the person of the individual employer, and by the legal fiction of a contract.7

The institutions of capitalism—specifically, money and labor—are integral to our desires because under its conditions they are the necessary precondition of any desire or any action.

Lordon draws from two different aspects of Spinoza’s philosophical anthropology. The first, as is noted above, is what Lordon refers to as the intransitive nature of desire. As much as desire constitutes humanity’s essence, it is not a desire for any specific object, for wisdom, or even for life itself, survival. Everyone strives for what they imagine, or think, will increase their power to act. The act of striving is universal, but what one strives for is not. The objects and inclinations of desire are made rather than given. What they are made from are the series of encounters and relations into which an individual enters; encounters and relations that include one’s biography, the history of one’s individual desires, but exceed it to include the structural conditions of one’s desires. Second, and perhaps more importantly, Spinoza argues that the mind has a tendency to dwell on things that increase its joy and power.11 Lordon argues that the effect of this is less some innate tendency toward liberation than an explanation of how people can put up with the most limited possibilities for joy and power. This second observation seems most appropriate to the world of work, not so much in the pleasures that are created by management (casual Fridays, forced socialization, etc.) but in the pleasures that one invents to get through the day—the camaraderie and little games that make work bearable. After all, how many people have been confronted by their tendency to stay in some dead-end job with the claim that “it is not so bad”? This assertion is generally followed by the invocation of those little bits of joy, fun, and sociality that can be wrested from almost any job to pass the time and make things slightly enjoyable.12 Our tendency to find joy in every situation is as much a source of subjection as it is the basis for liberation.

Lordon’s focus on the demand to maximally align the worker’s desire with that of the corporation highlights some of the shifts in corporate strategies used to manage workers. To take one recent example, Apple’s stores, which rank as the most profitable by square foot among other retailers, pursued a very particular strategy for increasing this alignment.15 This began in the hiring and selection process, which was made intentionally arduous in order to cultivate a sense of selection. Apple’s solution was to foster a sense of commitment to a higher calling while flattering employees that they were the chosen few to represent it. By counterintuitively raising the bar of admission, crafting a long series of interviews to weed out the mercenary or misanthropic, Johnson soon attracted more applicants than there were posts. Those keen enough to go through the onerous hiring process were almost by definition a better “fit” for the devotional ethos of the brand, far more receptive to the fiction that they weren’t selling things but, in an oft-repeated phrase, “enriching people’s lives,” as if they’d landed a job at a charity.16

It is how companies present themselves, but not how they actually function. Lordon argues that “neoliberal capital is the world of the girlfriend experience,” underscoring the demand to feel passionate about whatever job or task.18 In response to this, and doubling down on the misogyny of the allegory, Fleming writes that neoliberalism is that of “the deranged girlfriend experience.”19 Its dominant strategy is not an alignment of desire but a threat of abandonment, coupled with an ever-shifting set of demands. Its ultimate effect is not mobilization and motivation but a demoralized acceptance.

The belief that the next job will be different, that a career change could bring new forms of happiness and satisfaction, is the engine of the affective economy of capital—an engine that functions not only despite the fact that it breaks down, but because it breaks down. Experiences of frustrations fuel the fantasy of a better job. The individual fantasy of the dream job is itself a kind of “cruel optimism” toward the conditions of work in general.33

Once the old-guard military had seized control from the progressive officers in October 1979, it began a general war of extermination against all progressive individuals and organizations in El Salvador. By the end of May, church sources reported 1,844 civilian deaths already in 1980, a figure that reached 10,000 by the end of the year, almost all at the hands of the government. A guerrilla war was forced on the center and left by the policy of unconstrained violence of the Carter-supported government. The government was not centrist and reformist—it was a military regime of the right, closely linked to the terrorist force ORDEN and the death squads, and it used them regularly as proxies. The paramilitary groups were not uncontrollable—they were doing what the army wanted them to do. The paramilitary forces and death squads of EL Salvador had extensive interlocking relationships with the official military and security forces and their U.S. counterparts. There was a revolving door of personnel, close cooperation in sharing information, funding of the paramilitary groups by the official forces, and a division of labor between them. The paramilitary did jobs for which the official forces wished to disclaim responsibility.23 Although the paramilitary group ORDEN was formally abolished at the time of the October 1979 coup, it was secretly maintained and had a close relationship with the regular military establishment. According to one detailed account, The reformers had officially abolished ORDEN, the old information network. But . . . military officers suspicious of the young reformers secretly reestablished and expanded much of the old intelligence system into a grass-roots intelligence network that fed names of suspected subversives to military and paramilitary death squads. Four days after the coup, D’Aubuisson said in an interview, he was assigned by members of the high command to help reorganize ANSESAL [an intelligence communication network] inside a military compound under the chief of staff’s office—out of the reach of civilians in the new junta.24 This secret assignment of D’Aubuisson was confirmed by junta member Colonel Jaime Abdul Gutiérrez, and then Deputy Defense Minister Colonel Nicholás Carranza.25 The U.S. mass media, however, followed the Bushnell formula virtually without deviation: there was a “civil war between extreme right and leftist groups” (New York Times, Feb. 25, 1980); the “seemingly well meaning but weak junta” was engaging in reforms but was unable to check the terror (Time, Apr. 7, 1980). The U.S. mass media had featured heavily the reformist character of the revolutionary junta, but they uniformly suppressed evidence of the powerlessness, frustrations, and early resignation of the progressives, and their replacement by civilians willing to serve as “front men” for state terror. Román Mayorga, an engineer and university professor who had been the unanimous choice of the original coup plotters, resigned on January 3, 1980, along with Guillermo Manuel Ungo “and at least 37 of the highest ranking government officials, including the heads of all government agencies.”26 But for the media, these events never happened, and the junta was still a “weak centrist government . . . beset by implacable extremes” (New York Times editorial, Apr. 28, 1980), not a right-wing government of massacre.

The trial of the five immediate killers of the four women should have been presented in a Kafkaesque framework, but the U.S. media played it very straight. The trial took place three-and-a-half years after the acts of murder, despite the fact that the triggermen were immediately identified and despite enormous U.S. pressure. Two of three judges assigned to the case had resigned out of fear for their lives, and the only independent defense attorney had fled the country after a session of torture at National Guard headquarters. The defense at the trial made no effort to defend the men on the grounds of “orders from above,” although this is a standard defense in such cases, and significant evidence was available for use in this instance. The mass media failed to note the point, although it suggests fear, a deal, or both, and although, as we saw in the Popieluszko case, the media are sometimes immensely alert to cover-ups. In March 1984, former intelligence officer Santivánez stated that the guardsmen knew that “If they don’t name Casanova, they will get out of jail as soon as it is feasible.”70 This testimony was not referred to in the trial context—the media played dumb.

Contrary to his critical contemporaries, such as Feuerbach and Stirner, who believed in the power of ideas, and thus the weapon of criticism, Marx underscores that ideas only have power, only have effects, under particular material conditions that give some no time to think and others the means to spread and disseminate their ideas. Ideas have a causality that is derived not from them as ideas but from the social relations that produce and circulate them.

As has often been remarked, Spinoza made the question “Why do the masses fight for servitude as if it were salvation?” central to his political thought. The immediate answer to this question is superstition, which is a particular regime of signs and affects, a particular way of feeling and interpreting the world. As much as this seems like a question from a bygone age, Spinoza’s insistence on superstition, on imagination as the cause and effect of obedience, anticipates Michel Foucault’s famous assertion that the “soul is the prison of the body.”50 The most effective form of control or obedience is when people obey the state, or capital, while appearing to obey only themselves.51

These practices and habits attempt to shape the character of individual character (what Spinoza calls ingenium) in accordance with a collective national or religious character, creating the same associations, the same desires—resolving the double bind so that people obey the sovereign in appearing to obey only their own desires.

Workers assess the extent to which they can push for a pay rise – at least to compensate for the higher bills they must meet. Governments play the game too: do they intervene by using the greater income and VAT tax receipts f owing from the rising prices to assist weaker citizens being crushed by inf ation? Or do they subsidise Big Business as it is squeezed by high energy prices? Or do they do nothing much? Until these questions get answered, inf ation continues to roll.

If government dominates capital, as for example in China, inf ation dissipates when capitalists and rentiers acquiesce to a chunk of their loot being used to pay o a portion of the state’s def cits, debts or expenditures.

Following Nixon’s famous visit to Beijing in 1972, signalling America’s strategy to push a wedge between China and the USSR by establishing relations with the People’s Republic, following decades of non- communication and even war, America’s smart money envisioned China as a Japan- writ- large – a vision that Deng Xiaoping eventually indulged by opening up China to the West

we’d like to o er a de nition we feel is more speci c and precise, although it will take some unpacking: Capitalism is an economic system founded on colonial looting. It operates on a constantly shifting and selfconsuming frontier, on which both state and powerful private interests use their laws, backed by the threat of violence, to turn shared resources into exclusive property, and to transform natural wealth, labour and money into commodities that can be accumulated

Sugar production on the island peaked in 1506, just a few decades after it began. Then it fell precipitously, by 80 per cent within twenty years – a remarkable rate of collapse.Why? Because Madeira ran out of madeira. Stoking the boilers needed to re ne and process a kilogram of sugar required 60 kilograms of wood. The enslaved labourers had to travel further and further a eld to  nd this wood, extracting it from ever steeper and more remote parts of the island. In other words, more labour was needed to produce the same amount of sugar. In economic terms, the productivity of labour collapsed, tumbling fourfold in twenty years.

Cultural critic Stephen Metcalf points out that, ‘This is what makes neoliberalism “neo”.’6 He argues that previous doctrines, such as ‘classical liberalism’ or ‘laissezfaire economics’, had promoted, like neoliberalism, a ‘free’ market and a minimal state. Merchants from the seventeenth century onwards had demanded that governments leave them alone – to laissez- nous faire. But neoliberalism developed in a di erent era, by which point most adults had the vote. It recognized that, in the face of widespread resistance, the state would have to intervene to impose its desired political outcomes on an unwilling population, to liberate ‘the market’ from democracy. As Naomi Klein showed in her book The Shock Doctrine,7 neoliberalism has often been imposed on people during great crises: at moments when they were too distracted to resist – or even notice – the new policies that governments were slipping under their doors. It was introduced, for instance, by force in the aftermath of Pinochet’s 1973 coup in Chile. It was intensi ed in the wake of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the US administration captured and privatized the country’s assets. It was employed in 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans

In London in 1977, young Black people made up just 3 per cent of the population but they constituted 44 per cent of the arrests made under the ‘sus’ laws.65 The police force was almost exclusively white; for obvious reasons, ‘police offcer’ wasn’t regarded as a desirable job for Black and Brown people, and the informal colour bar meant that there were fewer than twenty-four Black offcers across the whole country in the mid-1970s

Citton’s emphasis on storytelling cuts between two formulations of ideology in the history of philosophy. The first, as we have already seen, is Marx’s assertion that the ruling ideas are the ideas of the ruling class. It is the assertion that ideology stems from the working classes’ tendency to adopt and adapt to the values of the ruling class, seeing themselves not as workers but as potential capitalists. The second, albeit first chronologically, is Machiavelli’s assertion that the ruler must appear to be of the people, governed by the same norms, beliefs, and habits.68 For Machiavelli, the basis of these beliefs was religion; it was important for the Prince to appear religious, but we can extend Machiavelli’s point to include the general idea that ruling ideas must in some sense be of the dominated class, incorporating their values and norms. The ruling ideas may be the ideas of the dominant class, but they must be articulated in and through the ideas of the dominated class.

Labor reproduces our natural existence, work produces the world of things (the made world that we reside in), and action creates the human world of individuality and plurality, the world of politics.

Tosel refers to this as communism of finitude—a communism that is not predicated on the infinite perfectibility of rationality as technology but rather works from and within determinate conditions. There is no organization of production that is not also a politics, a social relation. “The free association of producers” about which Marx wrote is still an association and still requires social-political relations. There is no way for the government of men to be replaced by the administration of things; we are always dealing with both social relations and material conditions. As finite beings, we necessarily are not only determined by our needs, constrained to produce and reproduce our existence, but we are also determined by politics, by social relations.24 As Spinoza put it, “We operate to produce effects in a certain and determinate manner.”25 There is no production that is not action, no praxis that is not poiesis, and vice versa.26

In a similar manner, Marx’s criticism of the way objects appear as bearers of value necessarily encroaches on the subject as well. This can be seen primarily in the way Marx fundamentally displaces the subject as the origin of meaning and value. The illusion, the value of commodities, is not the product of individual misrecognition or even some limitation of human consciousness, but is a social process.39 Nonetheless, it is a social process to which individuals contribute, but they are unaware of the role their participation plays. Commodity fetishism is less a subjective error, a misunderstanding of the world, than a necessary appearance of a social process, a social practice that also produces subjectivity. The fetishization of commodities extends, ultimately, to the commodity that one brings to the market in their person, namely labor power. It is not just commodities, things, that are fetishized, seen to possess value, but also subjective qualities and states that are all seen to have values, just as the world of things does.40

To Spinoza’s formulation we could add that the employee freely believes that they want to work. What is called motivation is nothing other than identifying with one’s compulsion. In each case, it is a matter of grasping a determination, a heteronomy, not just in those moments that feel constrained or confined but at exactly the point where one feels free.

Negative solidarity can be understood not just as a particular affect or a particular imagination (although it is in some sense both) but also as a particular strategic orientation. It is determined by the organization of production and action, by the economic and political restructuring of work that has attenuated class conflict and undermined workers; and, more precisely, it is structured by the way that these changes are both understood and imagined. To return to the bumper sticker referenced above, which alludes to millions on welfare, there is no understanding of the massive reduction of welfare (especially since the reforms passed by President Bill Clinton) or of how social welfare programs make up a small part of state and federal budgets. In its place there is a sense that if I am not benefiting from my work, if I continually see my wages decrease while working harder, then someone else must be benefiting. It is this imagined gap between an individual’s effort and their return that the figure of the welfare queen, the immigrant, or even the teachers union, fills. To some extent, negative solidarity offers a kind of bizarro-world version of the standard Marxist criticism of capital, an inversion: instead of recognizing the capitalist as the source of exploitation, and seeing the immense accumulation of money by the wealthiest as the answer to the discrepancy between work and wages, the declining economic status of work, it frames this question in terms of an insufficient dedication to work on the part of the immigrant, teacher, or public worker

The ideological function of such an inverted world is clear; what is less immediately clear, however, are its causal conditions. Why is indignation not aimed at the capitalist, the CEO, or the boss? A response to this returns to the intersection of Spinoza’s and Marx’s critiques of the individual and the subject. Previously, we grasped this criticism in terms of its representation of freedom and necessity, where the individual subject is seen to be free while the economy is perceived as ruled by law-like necessity. Actions attributed to the economy, including such things as layoffs, reduced hours, and other negative effects, are not presented as actions that are freely undertaken; they are no one’s choice but an effect of economic necessity. They are not actions but effects of unchanging laws, understood as the necessary conditions of competitiveness, profitability, or just simply necessity itself.

It is foolish to get angry at the weather. To which we could add the following assertion from Marx: that the more the economy is perceived as itself a kind of nature, or second nature, obeying its laws which are outside of human action or intervention, the less it is subject to the same affects, the same love or hatred that are reserved for politics.

That’s the same incubation tank that I sprang from – one where the stakes were no higher than your own personal academic status, and the goal was to prove how much smarter you were than everybody else.

The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. What they meant was that, up until they were writing, all the great upheavals of the world had been driven by one section of the elite toppling another.

While NATO is thought of as an alliance of existing militaries, it also expends much of its energy on the NATO Support and Procurement Agency, which lines up weapons deals between manufacturers and governments. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency is headquartered in Luxembourg with “operational centers” in France, Hungary, and Italy. It has a greater number of staff and handles greater amounts of money than does NATO itself. According to NATO’s 2023 annual report

There have been only 13 Secretaries General of NATO, one of whom (Willy Claes) served only a year because it was discovered he had previously taken a large bribe from a weapons dealer. The secretaries general have all been chosen by the “consensus” of NATO members. In those cases where we know which nations first backed a nomination, these nominees have always had early backing from the U.S.government. On some occasions, carrots and sticks used to achieve “consensus”— the sorts of things not allowed in actually democratic voting in a free world—have been made public. When Turkey objected to Anders Fogh Rasmussen as Secretary General, Turkey backed down after a deal was made to shut down an international television network disliked by the Turkish government (Roj TV).

NATO itself is not a nation and not a party to treaties. A case must be brought to the International Court of Justice against a nation. But cases can be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court against individuals, although thus far all individuals prosecuted have been from Africa and none from NATO or even NATO member or partner nations. That biased use of the court has a lot to do with NATO’s dominant member, the U.S.government

The movement intensifed across Annam, and from September on developed into an open insurrection. Demonstrators attacked the subprefectures of Nam Dan, Do Luong, Thanh Chuong, Nghi Loc (Nghe An), Can Loc, Ky Anh and Huong Son (Ha Tinh), cut telegraph lines, ransacked the native police stations, freed prisoners, set fre to railway stations and churches, and executed detested mandarins and notables. Two areas, Thanh Chuong and Nam Dan, were in total revolt. The militia no longer dared enter the villages. In October the insurrection reached Central Annam, where the subprefectures of Duc Pho (Quang Tri) and Son Tinh (Quang Ngai) were sacked. In September 1930, in the villages of Nghe An which had been abandoned by the notables and the local militia, the peasants began organizing themselves into soviets [popular councils]. They took over the administration and, without touching the landed property, proceeded to share out the communal land that had been annexed by the landlords. They confscated the rice reserves and distributed them to the starving, allocated agricultural work collectively

In Annam, on May 1, 1930, 1500 peasants from the Vinh area marched in silence, without placards, without ﬂags and without arms, to the match factory in Ben Thuy to join the workers. The commander of the indigenous militia had stationed thirty men inside the factory and ordered them to open fre. Fifteen of the marchers were slain and countless others wounded. In the village of Hanh Lam (Thanh Chuong)* the peasants assembled to occupy the communal lands that had been annexed by a landowner, who was expanding his holdings at the expense of the village. Again, the same slaughter: 16 dead and 15 wounded. The villages of Yen Tha and Yen Phuc were burned to the ground.

launched a literacy campaign. These soviets extended throughout the provinces of Ha Tinh, Can Loc, Thach Ha and Huong Son. Repression matched the scale of the insurrection: aerial bombardment and machine-gun fre were used to disperse gatherings of peasants. The Foreign Legion, the Colonial Infantry and the Native Guard set villages on fre, hunted to death the ﬂeeing villagers, and executed prisoners. On September 12, 1930, at Hung Nguyen, three kilometers from Vinh, carnage was inﬂicted from the skies; six bombs dropped from a plane killed more than 200 demonstrators.

. In the small brickworks I was able to observe the superexploitation of the proletariat by a rapacious rural employer class, in total complicity with the local notables. The wretched peons—men, women and children alike—were paid by the piece. Covered in mud, they ground up clay from dawn to sunset. What they earned was often not enough to pay off the loans plus interest advanced to them by the boss. Sometimes whole families were condemned in this way to a lifetime of slavery. Those who tried to escape were caught by the village notables and beaten by their exploiter as long as he felt like it. I will never forget the solid whip with its stingray cords hanging on the wall

Whether it’s the NHS using trans-inclusive language or young people socially transitioning, the story is always framed in the same way – trans people are a malign inﬂuence and want to corrupt otherwise ‘normal’ people and institutions.2 Once more, we’re seeing a minority community – in this instance, 0.5 per cent of the population in England and Wales – being turned into hyper-visible hate fgures.3 And yet again, real, material vulnerabilities are rendered invisible. Trans people experience greater rates of homelessness than the rest of the population, with a quarter of transgender Britons having experienced homelessness at some point in their lives

Theodore W. Allen, ‘there were no “white” people there; nor, according to the colonial records, would there be for another sixty years.’51 That didn’t mean that there weren’t any people who we would now call white in the Virginia colony – but that’s not how they would have considered themselves, nor how the law recognised them. ‘[They] had been English when they left England, and naturally they and their Virginia-born children were English.’ It took the passage of half a dozen decades before ‘white’ ‘would appear as a synonym for European-American’, and it wasn’t until 1691 that it frst popped up in Virginia law. The ‘white race’ had to be invented, argues Allen, in order to stop Anglo and African bond-labourers from uniting and rebelling against their shared oppressors. Whiteness meant that European-Americans, even of the lowest social status, were formally brought together under a system of privileges; Africans

Here’s why I’m not a liberal, or a social democrat. I believe that the politics that we’ve got are a reﬂection of the balance of class forces in society. And on the one hand, we’ve got billions of people who are splintered on the basis of nation, language, gender, sexuality, race and religion. Even within countries, where we at least notionally share a language and a geographic location, we make a virtue out of what divides us. We look at the idea of solidarity with suspicion, and instead fnd myriad ways of insisting that people who are set against one another by racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia are unable to identify shared interests with one another. We embrace the idea of being minorities, despite forming the majority class. And on the other hand our real opponents, the planet’s landlords, don’t feel the same way. Sure, they might compete with each other for market dominance. They might even play dirty to undermine their rivals. But when push comes to shove, they know where their class interests lie. When it’s time to resist regulation or dodge taxes, corporate landlords understand that they’re all in it together. The world’s elites, the minority of people with real power and wealth, are conscious of being a class. What the rest of us truly have in common with each other is that what we once had as the commons has been expropriated from us
